Link: Official site (opens in new tab)In Hope County, Montana, you might find yourself using a guided missile to kill a charging bear. Not because a missile is the best weapon to kill a bear with—a crossbow would be more sporting—but simply because you already have the weapon resting on your shoulder. A moment ago you used it to blow an enemy plane out of the sky and a boat out of the water, so dispatching a bear with it is just quick and convenient, and the sooner the bear is dead, the sooner you can get back to the important task at hand: breaking the county record for catching the heaviest golden trout.Welcome to Far Cry 5, where a quiet spot of fishing can and often will result in piles of burnt wreckage and scattered corpses. It's a chaotic and wonderfully ridiculous open world sandbox of destruction and violence where a short drive down a dirt road can quickly become a pitched battle, as enemy vehicles appear and engage you, friendly fighters arrive and open fire at them, and ravenous animals leap from the woods and attack both. When the smoke finally clears, you may realize you've forgotten where you were going in the first place. Then an eagle swoops down and attacks your face.If you're a Far Cry veteran, this probably all sounds familiar, and Far Cry 5 follows the same blueprint as Far Cry 3 and 4 with a few new tweaks but no massive changes. I'm good with that: Ubisoft refining its wild and turbulent sandbox formula rather than reinventing it suits me just fine. This time you play as a nameless deputy sheriff sent to Hope County to arrest Joseph Seed, a cult leader backed by a heavily-armed force of devoted followers who have taken control of the region using kidnapping, mass murder, and brainwashing as recruitment tools. Your arrest of Seed in the first five minutes quickly goes awry, and your law enforcement cohorts are captured by the cult. Stranded in the mountainous backcountry with no backup, the only way out is to liberate the whole dang area, farm by farm.Hope County is divided into three regions, each controlled by a member of the Seed family. Defeating them requires first collecting resistance points in their regions, which come from completing missions, liberating captured locals, destroying the cult's resources, and conquering their outposts. Between these objectives you'll have countless random skirmishes, as traffic, enemies, rebels, citizens, and wildlife constantly converge and clash. It's a busy wilderness. You're constantly swiveling your head around to see where the gunfire is coming from or what people are yelling about, and amusingly, the NPCs react with the same panicked urgency when noticing an enemy plane circling as they do when spotting an approaching skunk.This chaos of overlapping AI factions is almost always a good thing—the best parts of Far Cry are when crazy shit happens. It's just that crazy shit happens nearly constantly, which can occasionally be frustrating if you're hoping for a few minutes of silence to contemplate an environmental puzzle, admire the scenery, or catch a fish in peace.At one point I came across a quiet airfield with two planes parked on it, and thought I'd help myself to one. While preparing to attack the two cultists guarding it, I noticed some movement nearby: it was a bull fighting a mountain lion. As I engaged, one conflict spilled over into the other, and by the end of the fight more cultists had arrived (some in a helicopter), a wolverine had appeared and attacked a fleeing cow, a citizen had driven up in a tractor, two planes (in the air) got into a dogfight, another cultist drove up (in a different tractor), and the planes on the ground had exploded in the ensuing carnage. I had to settle for stealing one of the tractors, which I used to run over an angry bear that showed up late. Slacker.I got a great performance using ultra settings (only motion blur was turned off) on my GeForce GTX 980 at 1920x1080: I was typically between 60-65 fps with occasional dips into the mid-50's. James played on his 1070 and found it ran buttery smooth as well. Essentially, it's comparable to Far Cry 4, so if your PC ran that well you should see a similar performance from Far Cry 5. Read more in our comprehensive performance analysis. To join this chaos you've got a constantly growing arsenal of weapons, including throwable shovels you can awesomely impale enemies with, craftable dynamite and proximity mines, and a generous cache of machine guns, rifles, pistols, and my favorite, the RAT4 rocket launcher, which locks onto vehicles and lets you steer your missile after firing (say, into a bear). There are lots of ways to get around: cars, boats, plus choppers and planes that are just as easy to operate as cars and boats. Cheap perks unlock a grappling hook for climbing, a wingsuit for when you can't be bothered to climb back down, and infinite parachutes, perfect for hastily activating when you realize the roof you just jumped off was a bit higher than you thought.Enemy outposts, as they were in earlier Far Cry games, are the best thing about Far Cry 5. Survey them from a distance, tag enemies with your scope or binoculars, and note other features like alarm towers (which can be used by the enemy to summon reinforcements), caged animals (which can be set free to cause a wonderful ruckus), and explosive barrels (self-explanatory), then either slither around dispensing cultists one by one with melee attacks and silenced weapons, or go in loud with grenades and guns. There's always satisfaction in being stealthy enough to take an outpost without a single shot being fired, but I prefer a big noisy fight filled with explosions and ragdolling enemies which runs the gamut from exhilarating to hilarious.You can also rip up the joint with missiles and miniguns while hovering overhead in a helicopter, which is a bit mindless but makes for a nice change of pace from all the careful scouting and enemy tagging. You can fling raw meat over the wall and let hungry wolves and cougars tear your enemies' throats out, or rig proximity mines all over the place, sneak away, and wait for patrolling guards to start stepping on them. The freedom you have to approach outposts in different ways extends to a lot of side missions as well. You can fling raw meat over the wall and let hungry bears and cougars tear your enemies' throats out.The Far Cry series has often featured scalable towers that revealed new areas on your map, each with a slightly different configuration but still similar enough to result in what amounted to a repetitive chore of first-person climbing and jumping. While there are a few towers in Far Cry 5, they're only tied to side missions, you can just use a grappling hook to scale them, and they don't reveal map locations. Now you populate your map through exploration and getting tips from citizens, which is a great improvement. Filling in for those tower-climbing puzzles are 'prepper' stashes, caches of weapons, ammo, cash, and crafting resources, often in underground bunkers, sometimes booby trapped, flooded, locked, or with clues scattered around containing information on how to access them. Infiltrating these prepper stashes can be easy or hard, surprising or boring, annoying, spooky, deadly, or even require a bit of climbing—you never really know what's in a bunker, hideout, or cave, and that's a lot better than climbing a set of slightly different towers.Far Cry 5 needed a better villain. The Seeds are boring bad guys, way too talkative without ever saying much, and each will kidnap you multiple times—one can even drag you at will into extended hallucinations—thus interrupting your open world fun to make you suffer through their monologues before either giving you a chance to escape or simply returning you to a friendly bunker. Killing them—which sometimes involves a boss fight where the Seeds gain superhuman powers and take a ridiculous amount of damage before falling—feels less like justice for the county and more like simple relief at not having to listen to their drawn-out speeches any longer. ""Look at the headlines. Look who's in charge,"" one of the Seeds says, hoping to convince me that bringing about the end of the world is perfectly reasonable because the world is going to end soon anyway. Granted, this is a man who murders, kidnaps, and carves people's sins into their flesh with a knife, then cuts the flesh off and staples it to the wall. It's unclear why this disturbing practice has gained him hundreds of loyal followers, but he's got a point. The headlines sure are scary these days.Apart from a few scattered lines of dialogue, there's no cohesive message or statement about politics or fascism or militias or anything, really, in Far Cry 5. The cult leaders themselves don't even mention God or religion as often you'd expect, and the cult's motivations are pretty vague beyond killing or drugging everyone who doesn't want to join. Far Cry 5 wants to be whimsical like GTA 5 (""weaponized super-bears"" is spoken matter-of-factly), but its irreverence comes at the expense of developing interesting villains with clear motivations.I'm not surprised. Ubisoft didn't have a coherent or serious message about spying, surveillance, and privacy issues in Watch Dogs, either. I don't think any developer is obligated to include social commentary in their game, but to evoke so much of the visual language of religious fundamentalism and secessionism, and then not explore that stuff in any meaningful way, makes Far Cry 5 feel hollow. Seemingly scared of not pleasing everyone, Ubisoft avoided tackling deeper subjects altogether and decided that the villains were just weirdos.The dog can detect and tag enemies you can't see, the pilot can drop bombs and strafe targets from above, the bear is a bear.You're not alone in Far Cry 5 unless you want to be. There are generic NPC guns for hire you can bring along for support, and nine distinct AI companions you can recruit from side-missions scattered throughout the county. Three of the companions—the best ones—are animals (a dog, a bear, and a mountain lion), the rest are humans with backstories they won't stop blathering about even once you've heard every last anecdote and observation. You can bring one with you at a time (a perk can add room for another), and each has some useful skills depending on what sort of help you're looking for: the sniper can cover you while you fight at close range, the dog can detect and tag enemies you can't see, the pilot can drop bombs and strafe targets from above, the bear is a bear.  I didn't use companions that often—the two-legged ones are just too blandly chatty for my tastes—but I love romping around with a devoted bear at my side, and the biggest benefit of traveling with a buddy is that they can revive you if you've taken too much damage, saving you from death. Speaking of health, sadly absent in this Far Cry is the gruesome self-healing animation of past games, which I miss: watching yourself dig a bullet out of your flesh with a knife or resetting a broken bone with a crunch is more fun than simply winding some gauze around your arm. Alas.Far better than an AI buddy is a real one: you can play the entire game with a co-op partner, story missions and all. It's great fun to have a friend along for the ride in the chaotic sandbox of Far Cry 5, and taking down outposts with a coordinated co-op assault (or an uncoordinated one, for that matter) is even more enjoyable than doing it alone. It's easy to drop in and drop out no matter where you are in the game.A big, beautiful, chaotic canvas of freeform destruction, Far Cry 5 continues the series' best traditions. It's strongest when you get to decide how to tackle a challenge, and at its weakest when it strips you of your freedom and makes you listen to a super-powered boss slowly yammer about culling the weak or how pain will set you free. If you can stomach the occasional slow monologue from a dull zealot, you'll be back to blowing up bears in no time.The wonderful chaos of the open world and your choice of how to tackle it is occasionally stifled by bad boss fights and worse boss speeches.Chris started playing PC games in the 1980s, started writing about them in the early 2000s, and (finally) started getting paid to write about them in the late 2000s. Following a few years as a regular freelancer, PC Gamer hired him in 2014, probably so he'd stop emailing them asking for more work. Chris has a love-hate relationship with survival games and an unhealthy fascination with the inner lives of NPCs. He's also a fan of offbeat simulation games, mods, and ignoring storylines in RPGs so he can make up his own.Artist wins prestigious photography prize with AI, refuses the award, gets scrubbed from the competition, and says we need to talk about banning AI from this stuffHere's when Minecraft Legends unlocks for launchHow to unlock the Regal Tiger and Brilliant Beetle mounts in Minecraft LegendsBy Phil Iwaniuk6 April 2023By Dave James5 April 2023By Kizito Katawonga4 April 2023By Jacob Ridley4 April 2023By Ian Evenden4 April 2023By Jorge Jimenez3 April 2023By Luke Winkie3 April 2023By Ted Litchfield31 March 2023By Robin Valentine31 March 2023By Katie Wickens31 March 2023By Dave James30 March 2023PC Gamer is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Far Cry 5,Edwin Evans-Thirlwell,Eurogamer,https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-03-25-far-cry-5-review,"Make Montana emergent again. You can kick off a spectacular set piece pretty much anywhere in Far Cry 5. All you need do is stand in the road. Give it 60 seconds, and - yes, there it is, a van full of hostages, cruising around unescorted, the lowest of low-hanging fruit. You pour hot lead into the windshield until the driver flops out of his seat like a spent shell casing, then follow the vehicle into a ditch and help its dazed occupants to safety. One grateful civilian waves you over, a side quest icon materialising over his head. ""Wh-"" he says, and is promptly swept off his feet by a speeding pick-up truck. The truck screeches to a halt and a huge, tattooed lady with a light machinegun climbs out, only to be set upon by the cougar you didn't notice lurking near the treeline. Your AI companion blasts the cougar with incendiary buckshot, setting it on fire; the cougar charges into your AI companion, setting him on fire; everybody runs in circles, yelling at each other, until a plane soars over a hillside and bombs the whole, silly escapade to ashy gristle. Moments of unrehearsed, systemic inanity like these have always been Far Cry's calling card as an open world shooter, and the fifth game continues that proud tradition: between the hostage trucks, convoys, roadblocks, sniper's nests, air patrols, wildlife, plentiful explosives and cartoon physics, you'll seldom want for distraction (or incineration) on the way to the next story objective. Sadly, the game which unfolds around these interludes isn't half as enjoyable. The first instalment to be set in North America, Far Cry 5 is Far Cry at its least engrossing, clumsiest and most basic, though there's still just enough going on here to keep a returning fan involved. Its attempts to address the fractious state of US society through the lens of a game that is essentially about dominating an Orientalised world are a predictable mixture of half-baked and callous. The mechanics of exploration, combat and conquest, meanwhile, lack charisma and substance for all the longer development time, with few new tools or challenges to speak of. Save for its campaign co-op, jaunty Arcade level editor and bland 6v6 multiplayer, it very much feels like the filler episode Far Cry: Primal was supposed to be.Far Cry 5 casts you as a rookie police deputy, travelling to the fictitious county of Hope, Montana to arrest one Joseph Seed, the McConaughey-esque leader of the Christian doomsday cult Eden's Gate. Seed's followers don't take kindly to their prophet's abduction, needless to say, and one hectic car chase  sequence later, you're at large in a county that has become a warzone, sealed off from the rest of the US. Your job is to take down Seed's three siblings, John, Jacob and Faith, each the boss of a particular region and section of the cult's operations, before launching an assault on the Father himself. You'll be aided in this endeavour by a homespun resistance, including nine unlockable AI companions with fully fleshed-out backstories and an endless supply of more generic accomplices who can be recruited on the fly. It's business as usual for Far Cry, give or take a few local variations. You undertake story and side missions to fill up a bar representing local resistance levels: reach certain milestones, and the cult will redouble its efforts to bring you down, dispatching tougher foes such as fighter planes to hound your steps. As you sink your teeth deeper into each region you'll also be sucked into the odd clash with one of the Seeds, who'll typically monologue a bit before somehow allowing you to slip their clutches. Fill the bar up completely and you'll trigger a final battle, followed by a race to the region's bunker to rescue all the locals the cult has abducted - a corridor gunfight with the odd, very lightweight puzzle element. As campaign frameworks go it just about keeps you awake, and Montana makes for an appealing backdrop, though it lacks the visual variety of Far Cry 4's Kyrat. But it's also very bland, and more importantly, a serious obstacle for the game's hapless stabs at social commentary. Far Cry 5's key problem as a story is that it's utterly at odds with itself. It wants to say something about our world, about evangelical ecstasy, gun advocacy and nihilism in America's heartlands, but all of that plays second fiddle to the real core of any Far Cry game, a colonialist fantasy that imposes its own criteria on the writing - casts split neatly between identikit footsoldiers and larger-than-life lieutenants, a struggle for survival that can only ever involve the gradual flipping of nodes on a map. It wants to dissect anxieties about nuclear war and the rise of ""patriot"" movements in the US, but it also wants to be an ""anecdote factory"", in creative director Dan Hay's words - a game that teaches its player to think of the setting as a cauldron of apolitical ""gameplay"" props, waiting to be jostled about until something explodes. It wants to analyse how cults rise and fall, drawing upon consultation with real-life cult deprogrammers, but in practice the Pledgekeepers of Eden's Gate are just another army of expendable, dehumanised grunts, irredeemable from the get-go. Presumably, many are relatives or old acquaintances of the various friendly Montana residents you'll encounter, but the writing waves this aside; as far as your red-blooded American allies are concerned, the only good ""Peggy"" is a dead Peggy, whoever they used to be. Where the game does try to take you through the mechanics by which people become fanatics, it does so at the level of cheap sensation, via devices such as mass hypnosis or mind-altering drugs that can be easily translated into the brutal lingo of an action game. There's little sustained investigation of wider social factors, like the overlap between militant Christian extremism and white supremacy or sexism - indeed, the game generally ducks such questions. The cult's ranks are stocked with a mixture of races and genders, in what feels like a careful sanitising of the subject matter. Adding insult to injury, the tone is all over the place, as though several writing teams were fighting for control of the pen. Torture scenes and talk of rape and infanticide sit alongside unspeakably lame wisecracks in weapon descriptions and spoofing of Donald Trump. One moment you're following a scarred huntress around while she weaves a story about cannibalism, the next you have to rescue a bear called Cheeseburger. It's possible to get away with these kinds of tonal shifts - see the Wolfenstein series under MachineGames - but you need a lot more flair than is on offer here.Where Far Cry 5's narrative is merely bad, the moment-to-moment of play is a cunning blend of competent and boring. Much of the action revolves around securing outposts, and these are structured exactly as in previous games - their compact layouts dotted with mounted turrets, vehicles you might turn into timebombs, cage locks you can shoot off to loose a wild animal amongst the guards and alarm systems you can disable to thwart the summoning of reinforcements. It certainly takes a bit of thought, and there are a few missions that change the tempo by, for example, forcing you to sneak for fear of a hostage being executed, but none of it is memorable. Far Cry's outpost design has been ripped off and bettered by any number of open worlders, within and without Ubisoft. Now would have been a good time to throw a few curves, and yet the game's assorted gas stations, ranches, airfields and hilltop bases are as unsurprising in structure as they are easy to upturn.The outposts might be more fun to roll over if your arsenal and customisation options weren't so deathly dull. There's no standout new weapon or gizmo, just the usual crop of SMGs, shotguns, rifles, pistols, launchers, flame throwers, light machine guns and bows, all very lightly accessorisable with scopes and expanded magazines. The kinesis of Far Cry combat is as mouth-watering as ever - no other shooter save Battlefield quite grasps the joy of lobbing a perfectly timed grenade beneath the wheels of a speeding car - but the lack of inventiveness is startling. The perks system is just as insipid: it consists largely of passive upgrades like inventory expansions and faster reloads per weapon category, plus familiar active abilities like the repair torch and wingsuit. The practice of chaining melee executions - one of Far Cry 3's most vicious flourishes - returns but has been strangely de-emphasised, bundled up into a single unlock. It's one of several, promising systems the new game might have elaborated upon; instead, Ubisoft has stripped it back.In some respects, Far Cry 5's heart of hearts doesn't lie anywhere in Hope, Montana. It lies in Far Cry Arcade, a map editor where the fundamentally reductive nature of Far Cry's open world is caught in the neon glare of a faux coin-op interface. Here, you're free to bodge together and share your own PvE or deathmatch levels within a generous memory budget, using assets lifted from previous Far Cry games, Watch Dogs 2 and Assassin's Creed: Unity. There are some entertaining concoctions on the servers already, which you can sample at random as part of a 6-12 player group or tackle all by yourself - a barebones yet surprisingly moreish shooting range in which all players wield AK47s, and a crackpot neon labyrinth of water traps and jump ramps that could almost be a nod to Action Half-Life.The real intrigue of the Arcade mode, however, is that it exposes how Ubisoft's open world games have become slaves to a formula. In letting you mingle pieces from several franchises - the skyscrapers of San Francisco towering over the ruins of a daydream Tibet, the cannons of revolutionary France lifting rusted muzzles amid the splintered daylight of backwoods America - the editor reveals their basic interchangeability, the way all of these series default to the same broad framework of killing, conquering and unlocking. This is the apparently inescapable truth of Far Cry, a series that still has a lot going for it, but remains in serious need of a revamp. It is a moribund apparatus of conquest that is unable to tell any story other than the rise to power of a well-armed outsider over a lushly imagined, exoticised realm, however urgently it might try.

Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy.There’s a wolverine biting my balls. Which I wasn’t expecting to happen but really need do something about. Far Cry 5 is built on this sort of problem solving. Brilliant, terrible, ‘what was I thinking?!’ or ‘how did this happen’ disaster management where the solution is usually shooting, explosions and often a great deal of regret - part slapstick, part exercising the right to bear arms, and part actual bears. Why did I throw a petrol bomb inside the house? What was I expecting the truck coming at me to do when I shot the driver’s face off? I’ve made 20 murderous cultists very, very angry, AMA. The initial impression is that this is more of the same - liberating bases in an open world crammed with chaos and random animal attacks. That’s by no means a bad thing. This is full of spur of the moment combat as you adapt and invent tactics on the fly; always rewarding and fun, with a chaotic push and pull that can kill hours and finish up with you realising you never even got near the thing you originally set out to do. It will eat your weekends and snack on the evenings.11 things to know before you play Far Cry 5 (opens in new tab)But take a step back and it’s obvious that while the core ‘oh God I’m on fire and everyone’s shooting at me’ gameplay is familiar, there are lots of clever tweaks. Everything's been tightened up, refreshing the mix and creating a more streamlined pace. For example, towers are gone - there are no maps spammed with markers after climbing one. Instead you find things in the world by talking to people and actually looking around. It creates a more unpredictable and organic feel to progress. Rather than unlocking 30 objectives at once and chin-stroking on what to do next, you’re out exploring and seeing what you can find. Missions and information feel more meaningful when you have to earn them and it doesn’t take long before you've plenty of things to choose from. It all helps build on the idea that you're just the little guy in someone else's world. You're the flea on the dog's back, not the dog. Even key story missions are out of your control - triggered by progress, meetings with bad guy leaders become unpredictable interjections as you're snatched when they feel like it, not when you decide to see them. The world is smaller too, but denser in return. So while the map is much reduced - only three regions to Far Cry 4’s six - you never feel short changed. There’s always… a thing, somewhere, waiting to happen to you. It usually involves screaming and not always yours. So it’s leaner, but what’s been removed is the stuff in between the action, not the action itself. In Far Cry 5 crafting (opens in new tab) is all but gone for example, reduced to making explosives and buff potions in the weapon wheel. All those ammo capacity increases, and things you’d previously spend hours chasing animals for, are moved into the game’s perk system. It cuts away the fat of previous games, just leaving the meat of what makes the series good. Some things don’t change. You’re still exploring a troubled place - a fictional American midwestern rural community under the thumb of a doomsday cult called Eden’s Gate - and working with the locals to fight back and build a resistance in Far Cry 5 (opens in new tab). You’re liberating bases, balancing speedy, sprinting stealth with the almost inevitable messy, loud conclusion once you trigger an alarm. There are people to rescue, side missions to nibble, events and set pieces aplenty to keep you busy. Prepper stashes are a particular joy among all this. Building on the Doomsday prepper themes there are supply rooms hidden around the world full of weapons, gear, perk points and more. You never quite know what you’ll get - both in terms of reward or challenge. Some are climbing puzzles, some are underwater, one is in a tower full of wasp nests you have to try and avoid disturbing. There are story-focused ones and plenty more I won’t spoil (including one of the best bits of the whole game). They’re always unpredictable, interesting, and a great way to break up the action. Whatever you do in all this, the idea of being part of a team is stronger now with Far Cry's GUNs for hire (opens in new tab), and FANGs can pick up. There are six people and three animals you can choose from to fight alongside you (one at a time initially) using a range of tools to vary your options and capabilities. Nick Rye has a strafing, bomb dropping plane, for example, while Grace Armstrong brings long range sniper support. Other characters have flamethrowers, helicopters and there are generic ‘fighters’ - basically no name soldiers you can hire in a pinch. Pet-wise you could choose Cheeseburger the bear (opens in new tab) for tanking savagery, Boomer the dog (opens in new tab) for highlighting enemies, and Peaches the cougar (opens in new tab) for silent kills on command.You’ll have your favorites, but once you start switching them out for different missions the game opens up immensely. Especially when you unlock a 'Leadership' perk that lets you have two companions at once. At that point Far Cry 5 becomes a different game as you move from lone gun to leader of a (small) army. Not bothered about stealth and just need to blow shit up? Call in Adelaide's chaingun-armed chopper and Hurk with his rocket launcher. Need to save hostages without setting off alarms? Get Jess in with her bow and Peaches to despatch bad guys without a whisper. The commands are simple - go there, kill this - but when you coordinate an attack and pull if off, it feels amazing. Perhaps the only thing I didn't really click with was a maybe an over reliance on hostage rescue to balance the otherwise repercussion free carnage, and some largely flat villains.  I just didn’t feel much for the cult leaders - the defeat of which the entire game hinges on. In a series that’s seen star turns from Vaas and Pagan Min, Joseph Seed and his clan don’t quite have the same pop. Which is odd when the world and everything in it is full of character, and the tone is often darker and more sinister than before (the opening is an amazingly tense sequence). There are serious horror/crime thriller vibes in places, with environmental and incidental storytelling creating a grimer and less fanciful take on the usual Far Cry narrative. The familiar US setting, and the fact that real life events like Jonestown and Wako actually happened, make this feel more plausible in some ways than distant Tibetan despots and feudal tropical islands. However, the subdued portrayal of its cult leader, and sub-bosses, lacks impact. They should project menace that makes your skin prickle, and they don’t. out of Jospeh, Jacob, John and Faith, only ex-soldier Jacob has any really edge or depth to his presence. Tonally it feels pulled in different directions between the primary colour comedy of characters like Hurk or Adelaide (frat boy ass humour and ‘older women talking about sex is funny’ respectively) and its attempt to create a more subtle evil from a cult leader that could actually exist. It almost feels transitional, taking a half step towards being more serious but not fully committing. The tonal inconsistencies are more a case of not quite hitting the mark rather than missing the target completely, though. The overall thrust is still an entertaining cacophony of animal attacks, accidental fires, plan Bs, and bad guys to beat. There’s loads to enjoy and design tweaks tighten everything up. Just the single player element is enough to make this worth playing but then there’s the fact you can tackle the entire campaign in co-op, adding a brilliant layer of two player calamity, and the Arcade map creator. I’ve only dabbled briefly but built a simple assassination mission in a mountain lodge, and checked how many turkeys it takes to kill a bear (12, if you’re interested). It’s an accessible dev-level creation system full of props, terrain editors, enemies, AI and gameplay modifiers. Whether you want to cobble together a few things and see what happens, or start your development career, it’s got you covered. It’ll also provide plenty of new single player, co-op and multiplayer levels to take on after the stories done. Far Cry 5 is a continuation of everything you remember about the series, but an instalment that’s taken a good look at itself, and what it does, to work out the best possible way of doing it. The compact, more streamlined design never feels small and instead comes across as more achievable and event filled. How often have you finished a Far Cry with a ton of missions and bits you never got around to doing? That’s that stuff that’s been paired back. What remains are the best bits - the pure, distilled chaos of the series more manageably portioned and packaged.I'm GamesRadar's Senior Guides Co-ordinator, which means I run GamesRadar's guides and tips content.

Far Cry 5,Jeff Cork,Game Informer,http://www.gameinformer.com/games/far_cry_5/b/playstation4/archive/2018/03/26/far-cry-5-game-informer-review-big-sigh-country.aspx,"After targeting tin-pot dictators and megalomaniacs across the globe, Far Cry 5 sets its sights closer to home. This entry moves the open-world mayhem to Hope County, Montana – a beautiful base of operations for outdoorspeople, rugged individualists, and a murderous death cult. It’s also a playground for the explosive antics that we’ve come to expect from the series, where you and a friend can seamlessly go from taking down an armed convoy to bow hunting to fly fishing – or flying a plane – depending on what sounds fun. Once the luster of the new setting and co-op companionship wears thin, however, you’re left with an experience that’s familiar to a fault.Hope County has been overrun by Joseph Seed, leader of an apocalyptic cult called Project at Eden’s Gate. A disastrous raid on Joseph’s compound leaves your created character, a rookie sheriff’s deputy, alone and outnumbered in a hostile environment. The setup is interesting, but soon settles into a standard routine. Your job is to clear out the Peggies (the local slur for the cultists) by any means necessary – most of which boils down to reclaiming outposts and taking on missions for the locals. Joseph has a lot of land to cover, and he’s a master at delegating. His church heralds include the charismatic John Seed; hunter of man Jacob Seed; and psy-ops hippie Faith Seed. These three walking archetypes have little consistency between them apart from their last names.Far Cry 5 isn’t as provocative as its posturing may lead you to believe. Its exploration of religious extremism is too bizarre to be taken seriously, and it’s delivered with a self-serious tone that it doesn’t earn. You get knocked out, abducted, and tied to a chair a ridiculous number of times. Since your character is mute and can’t (or won’t) engage in conversation, you end up with extended scenes where vamping bad guys talk at your immobilized form and over-explain their half-baked philosophies. Some moments attempt to subvert your expectations, but they’re generally limp commentaries along the lines of saying, “Ah, yes, but have you considered that YOU are the real villain here?”The story doesn’t offer many big surprises or payoffs, and the same can be said for the gameplay. It’s competent on most fronts, providing a massive world to explore and an arsenal of destructive tools, but it doesn’t feel fresh. Taking down outposts doesn’t provide any new thrills or challenges, and new items like proximity bombs don’t open up encounters. Past games introduced strategy and light puzzle elements as you were rewarded for staking out these camps and figuring out how to take advantage of their weak spots. The Peggies seem more interested in maintaining their human flock than setting up decent defenses. They all follow the same basic setup: A couple of guys are on roofs, one or two have set up shop by the alarms, and a handful of bearded weirdos linger near the explosive barrels. You’re certainly welcome to scout the bases and direct your A.I. companions to help you remain undetected, but going in with guns blazing is just as effective and definitely more efficient. You may miss out on a few cash bonuses, but I was generally flush throughout the game and at no point felt like I was missing out. Vignettes showing former residents reclaiming each outpost are satisfying, but getting to those points isn’t particularly gratifying.Ubisoft Montreal does break from past games in a couple of major ways. First, your deputy doesn’t reveal the world around them by climbing towers to get a better view. Instead, you remove the fog on your map by doing missions and finding maps scattered in ranger stations and other structures. Environmental puzzles are still here in the form of lucrative prepper caches, which are one of my favorite parts of Far Cry 5. Each one offers a unique challenge, which can include escaping a trapped bunker or navigating a mountain obstacle course, with big rewards at the end of each one. I got excited every time an NPC conversation put a new cache icon on my map. The second major break from tradition is a decreased focus on hunting; animal pelts are only redeemable for cash, and are no longer associated with crafting. I enjoyed the survival aspect from past games, as silly as it was, and it felt strange to see a previously important part of the series fall to the side like that. Instead of using skins to build holsters and ammo pouches, now you invest points in upgrades as you see fit. The game is generous with the points, which you earn through mission progression and challenges, and it’s easy to prioritize abilities to how you like to play. For instance, if you prefer diving into fast-travel locations from the air instead of spawning on the ground, you can choose to do that. Or you can prioritize potions, making it easier to find the required components and reduce their cost. You will be able to pick up most, if not all, of these perks along the way, so it doesn’t matter too much in the long run. Dismantling Jacob Seed’s operations could be downright tedious if not for one of the game’s most fleshed-out systems. The Guns for Hire, A.I. companions that you recruit to fight alongside you, add some much-needed variety to the game. There are nine of them to find in the world, and you have to complete a special mission to convince them to tag along. It’s generally worth it. You can bring two of them on your adventures in the solo game, and finding effective combos is part of the fun. Feel like being stealthy? Bring Grace, a sniper, and a tamed cougar named Peaches. Would you rather go a little crazy? Put Hurk (and his RPG) in your crew. Each companion brings something special to the table, too, such as dog Boomer’s ability to automatically mark targets for you. It makes playing solo feel less lonely, and I got a kick out of experimenting with different pairings. The best pairing is with another player, however, and that’s where the game shines. For the first time in the Far Cry series, you can play through the entire campaign in co-op. Having a second player around makes the game significantly more entertaining (even if the difficulty balance seems tailored for one), and exploring the playground together is a blast. I had a great time tormenting my partner, whether I was luring him under beehives, blowing up dynamite inside our plane, or rigging his car with explosives. Players are tethered together, so you can’t freely roam around the entire world independently, but it’s a generously long leash. It was never an issue during my time with the game, aside from a few times when I hopped in a plane and took off before my partner could join me in the cockpit. The scripted tasks can feel like chore lists, but players who enjoy messing around with systems can find plenty to love. It’s worth noting that you’ll need to find a charitable partner, since only the host’s mission and world progress is saved. Your buddy will keep their character progression and inventory, but they’ll have to repeat everything else on their own game. The experience isn’t necessarily about beelining through the critical path, however. If you don’t take the time to talk to NPCs, you miss out on a wealth of side missions, which are generally more interesting than being talked at for the Nth time by one of the Seeds. Still, Far Cry 5 doesn’t deliver on exploring the lives of people who live in this Red-Dawn-meets-David-Koresh nightmare. You can read notes that outline some of the challenges the characters have faced, but the tragedy isn’t typically explored through gameplay. Instead, you’re asked to chase down baseball cards for a former player who is sad, or harvest bull testicles for a picnic. Those moments of levity are especially jarring when you routinely drive past corpses that have been hung from bridges or strung up in grotesque effigies. “I guess I can help you catch that lunker, ma’am, but have you noticed that your neighbors have been crucified?”Public executions aside, Far Cry 5’s world is meticulously constructed, and it’s a remarkable facsimile of Big Sky Country. Unfortunately, too much of the action in it is uninspired. It’s a beautiful but bland recitation of what’s come before, from both the series and Ubisoft’s open-world playbook. It’s never bad, but considering how great the past games have been, its overall predictability is disappointing.

Far Cry 5,Ben Kuchera,Polygon,https://www.polygon.com/2018/3/26/17164878/far-cry-5-review-ps4-pc-xbox-one,"Filed under:A horrible story ruins an enjoyable worldFar Cry 5 had the potential to say something interesting by setting the game in America, but its murky story and themes do more to taint the game’s fantastic and playful open world than to give it purpose and meaning. The goofy world and the serious story never line up, making this one of the rockiest entries in a series that has already delved so deeply into action tourism. It’s yet another mainstream game that takes crisis or tragedy and builds a Ferris wheel on top of it, while intimating that you’re bad for wanting to take a ride.Far Cry 5’s story starts on a hollow note and never improves. The Project at Eden’s Gate, a religious cult whose followers are pejoratively called “peggies,” wants to carve out a chunk of land in the U.S. where its members can enjoy their religion and guns without being harassed by the government. You, of course, represent the government. As a deputy sheriff, you initially try, and fail, to arrest their leader, Joseph Seed, in a lengthy action scene that ends with you being rescued by a “prepper” who just so happens to be ready for exactly this sort of situation. It’s a timely story that could at least try to address the polarized nature of current American politics, or talk about the issues inherent in a country that seems to worship firearms. But I never saw anything that hinted at how these cultists were radicalized. And their ultimate goal, revealed at the end of the game, undercuts any grand statement.The “everyone is bad!” argument pops up often. In one jaw-dropping sequence, you leave a scene of torture perpetrated by the bad guys, only to end up in the bunker of the “good guys.” Guess what they’re doing? If you said “torturing someone to get information,” you win. These two situations literally happen back to back, without anyone in the game remarking on it. You can be in a cult, or you can fight a cult, but torture is worth it and effective either way!Equally flabbergasting is that many of the peggies are taking part in this violence because of a drug called “bliss.” You can tell when characters are under the influence of the drug from the green cloud around their heads; bliss is used as a shortcut to get away from realistic storytelling and dive back into tired video game tropes. A boss fight with a character who warps around the level, complete with a health bar, is as ridiculous and pointless as it sounds. The drug is meant to dehumanize the characters, so you feel more like you’re gunning down zombies than humans. However, the game totally fails to recognize the horror of shooting American drug addicts while the nation deals with a very real ongoing opioid crisis.The general absence of context in Far Cry 5 feels intentional, as if to smooth over any potentially controversial edges. You’re fighting against a conservative religious cult that has taken control of a big chunk of Montana, which made some conservative and Christian commentators uncomfortable during the game’s initial marketing. Those folks shouldn’t worry; any thematic point to be made about religion, the United States or the current state of the nation’s politics is quickly thrown aside to make way for all sorts of jokes and lighthearted hijinks — although you’ll also see a lot of crucifixions in your travels. It’s clear that this is a cult based on Christianity, but holy hell, is the game careful to dance around that fact. Ubisoft wanted the evocative art of these religious references for the marketing of Far Cry 5, but the game itself is too timid to do anything with them, let alone dig into their historical baggage.Even the lead character is a blank slate. You have no name or backstory other than being in law enforcement. You get to choose whether you look masculine or feminine before diving into the robust character creator to craft your look, from skin tone to clothing. You’re called either “deputy” or “rookie” as the game progresses, and you never speak. This must have made it easier for Ubisoft to offer co-op through the entire story (even if only one player is able to make progress in the story in their saved game in this mode), but it’s definitely a shift from past Far Cry games, which made the player character a large part of the world and lore. It’s a shame that Far Cry 5 is propped up by a weak story with bland characters, because behind the plot is an open world filled with what Far Cry as a series does best. Between story missions, you’ll be assaulting bases and tackling side missions to regain control of geographic areas, and you’ll unlock a progressively impressive list of vehicles to get around the countryside. That includes planes, in a series first, although the flying controls are so arcadey that the inclusion doesn’t feel like a huge departure from previous games. Bombing runs against cult convoys sure are satisfying, though. All of Hope County, Montana, is unlocked the moment you stagger out of the bunker in the game’s opening — nothing is gated, and hunting has been demoted to a sport that’s only done for money. That’s right: You don’t have to kill adorable wildlife to make progress or upgrade your gear. Improving your character is done through the perk system, and you earn points by completing challenges like killing a certain number of enemies with explosives. You’ll also find perk upgrades in the bunkers you raid from doomsday preppers who have fled the area. Briefly, on preppers: There’s this strange subtext to Far Cry 5 that will openly tell you that preppers were right to fear the worst, but it’s undercut by the fact that so many of them fled when things got bad. I guess they weren’t as willing to fight against an insurrection as they thought? The preppers were planning for a war that would require them to take their country back, while the followers of the Project at Eden’s Gate are also attempting to take their country back, and your job is to take the country back from them. The contrasting ideas there are some of the more complicated and funny aspects of this whole mess, but the game does little with this idea of entitlement. It’s yet another wasted opportunity.The lack of story depth is a shame, because this is one of, if not the best, playgrounds in the Far Cry series. Far Cry 5 feels like Ubisoft Montreal has learned which parts of the past games felt like work and which parts were fun, and it has focused with great intensity on producing more of those fun parts. A character even cracks a joke about not forcing you to climb towers around Hope County, a wink at one of the series’ most overused side objectives. Every part of Far Cry 5’s systems for progression and reward feel tuned to within an inch of perfection, and my favorite hours of the game were spent fishing, exploring the open world, and gaining more perks and tackling the interesting little puzzles that make up each prepper stash.Montana itself is modeled with an eye toward the region’s natural beauty, and the setting looked wondrous in my time playing on a PlayStation 4 Pro hooked up to a 4K display. The nature-trotting portions of the game feel like a commercial for the state. I want to take a break from murdering all those cultists to just camp for a few days, but alas, there’s always someone around who needs killing. The game does at least reward your fishing efforts. I wonder how much more I’d enjoy Far Cry 5 with a combat-free tourism mode akin to the recent add-on for its sibling series, Assassin’s Creed.I also appreciated the unexpected silliness of Far Cry 5. One of the best additions to the game is an escort system that allows you to hire and fight alongside up to two other characters from a pool of people you meet in the game, each of whom brings special skills into combat. That’s all well and good — it’s nice to have a sniper who’s got your back — but you can also befriend and hire animal buddies to help you in your travels. I stopped paying attention to the human sidekicks after I started prowling around Montana with a cougar and a dog as my companions.The animal hijinks don’t stop there. During one liberation mission, I aimed at a cultist, missed my shot and accidentally freed a bear. The bear was set on fire somehow, and the fire-bear ate a bunch of people while I watched through my weapon’s scope. That was a pretty good time. And I can’t count the amount of times I rescued friendly citizens from the militia, only to have them be eaten by cougars. Far Cry 5 also introduces an arcade mode (playable solo and in co-op) that includes a powerful map editor, allowing you to create challenges and share them with other players, who can earn cash and perks that will be helpful in the campaign. The arcade mode is accessible through the arcade cabinets you find around Hope County. I had a blast playing through some of the early levels created by Ubisoft’s designers, including one strange experience that took place in a topsy-turvy haunted house. Hopefully the community will come up with some interesting stuff after launch.For now, we’re left with the core campaign. Far Cry 5 uses the religious and isolationist divides in America to set up a story without ever addressing their history and their very present danger, and the story seems to give most of your enemies a get-out-of-jail-free card to explain their actions.They weren’t bad; they were just drugged! And the main antagonist, well. if you hadn’t picked a fight, maybe none of this would have happened! This sort of argument — that you are complicit in the violence that the game portrays and the villains take part in because you decided to play the game — was interesting when Spec Ops: The Line did it back in 2012, but has grown tiresome in the repetitions since. Far Cry 5 makes fun of everyone on the political spectrum, without ever taking a clear stand except to say, with toothless confidence, that murderous cults are bad. But maybe fighting them makes you just as bad, and in the end none of this matters anyway! It’s a story that goes nowhere and ends with a whimper, at least in the ending I saw. There seem to be two endings, although I doubt there’s a way to salvage the narrative in the last minutes after so many blown opportunities.What’s left if you have the stomach to ignore the story? A very enjoyable game with an immense number of things to do, a beautifully recreated portion of the United States, and a collection of missions with wildly varying tones and structure. It’s a finely tuned open-world game stapled onto a story that’s insultingly bad.Far Cry 5 was reviewed using a final “retail” PlayStation 4 download code provided by Ubisoft.

        Privacy PolicyenterFar Cry 5's story is a real let-down, but the action still makes for a solid co-op experience.The setting and ideas of Far Cry 5 have a ton of promise that don't bear much fruit in the final product. There's probably a great story you could tell around a Christian Doomsday Prepper Cult that has you fighting them off as they prepare for the End Times by murdering everyone around them and stealing all the resources they can. That's meat that few games even attempt to chew. But the ambitious setting doesn't pay off in this story that seems to want to hedge every chance it gets. The end result is a story that goes nowhere, says nothing, and fails to live up to the previous settings and villains in the franchise. If you can get past that... the rest is pretty much fine if you're up for another Far Cry game.The cult you're fighting has four leaders. Three control territories, and once you've executed enough missions in those territories, you can take that area back. Take over all three territories and you'll trigger the game's final mission against the Father, Joseph Seed, who looks and acts like a C-tier Matthew McConaughey character. Each cult lieutenant gets a bit of screen time as the game very much overuses the idea of you getting captured and hauled off to listen to a bunch of rudimentary rambling from the torture guy who looks like a low-rent coke dealer, the lady pumping hallucinogens into the water to ensure an orderly flock, or the ex-military guy who wants to train people like they were Pavlov's dogs. I found that most of the long speeches from these characters just go in circles and don't actually give any of them any real weight. They aren't charismatic the way Pagan Min was, they aren't menacing the way Vaas was, either. They seem flat. Monotonous, even.The lack of conviction in Far Cry 5 permeates the entire product. It doesn't just make its bad guys feel like generic, uncharismatic cultists. The militias and other characters you befriend along the way are also just... there. Maybe it'd be interesting to know why this particular valley in Montana has multiple militias and what their whole deal is beyond ""we're a militia and we hate this cult."" Maybe it'd be nice if you occasionally met a meaningful character who wasn't already armed and talking about what's up with ""their squad"" mere days after the cult started going nuts. For as much as it's disappointing that the villains aren't given enough dramatic weight, the way the game portrays rural America is somehow even darker. Everyone is either crazy, stupid, or both. Multiple missions involve ""getting someone's truck back, aw shucks, we sure loved that truck."" Meanwhile, after you've rescued dozens of people including a guy who owns a freakin' airplane, no one thinks to revisit the game's first idea of ""we should drive to Missoula and get on the phone to someone about this."" In the end, most NPCs are just people holding guns, wearing distressed American flag T-shirts, telling you about some paramilitary shit they got into or want to get into. Meanwhile, the first ""good"" prepper you meet is a vet with a USA jacket and a Canadian accent. It doesn't feel like a believable portrayal of rural life, even rural life under extreme duress.Because so much of the game traffics in mindgames, either via Faith Seed's drugs or Jacob Seed's brainwashing--large parts of the game's biggest moments are spent with the screen all filtered or wavy because you're ""not right in the head."" You'll see things that might not be there, you'll do things that would definitely be impossible, you'll see stuff that couldn't possibly be happening. That's fine, up to a point. Beating one of the cult lieutenants who can seemingly teleport around at will, control minds directly, and both fly and shoot fireballs at you during her boss fight is a decent departure from reality, but with so much of the game leaning on this seemingly supernatural stuff, it's hard to take any of it seriously.I guess I won't get into specifics, but did the earth-shaking events of the final confrontation even happen? Considering you're able to load back into the world after the credits and play like nothing happened, I want to say that it was all just another drug trip in a game with far too many drug trips. It only further undermines the potential of setting a Far Cry game in Montana and taking on a religious cult. At one point the leader of the cult gives the generic ""free will is an illusion, maaaaan"" speech and I nearly started just skipping cutscenes. The story leans on altered states and empty words too heavily and feels utterly weightless as a result.The rest of it is fairly par for the course when it comes to Far Cry. Some changes have been made around the edges, some are improvements, some aren't. The more organic way you happen upon side missions and fill out your map is a nice touch. You'll find friendly AI characters out in the woods who will tell you ""hey, this youth camp has been turned into a cult outpost, we should go kill 'em"" and that will pop an outpost marker on your map. Or you might just stumble into the outpost while going from place to place. The cultists like to hold hostages, and saving a hostage usually gives you a person who will fill in another point on the map. This is a meaningful step up from the old ""climb tower, populate region"" style.Despite multiple missions dealing with truck recovery, the missions usually feel like they fit into the world more organically, too. The game feels less like a set of checklists while also helpfully contextualizing the overtly checklist-y quests like ""destroy all cult equipment in this region"" or ""save X hostages in this region."" There are interesting little ""prepper stashes"" that require a bit of puzzling out to unlock. The game has its share of goofy side characters, some of which work, while others most definitely do not. I'd also argue that the goofy side characters further take away from the potential for a weighty main story, but considering how far off the mark the game is with the tone of its main quests, the idiots on the side were a lot more welcome.Player progression has been rebuilt via an in-game achievement system instead of the standard experience points and perk trees. Doing specific things, like getting 10 pistol kills, gives you points that can be spent on perks. Most perks don't have any prerequisites, so you can more or less grow your character as you see fit. That said, being forced to play the game in stunty ways, like getting flamethrower kills even though the flamethrower isn't a particularly great or fun or useful weapon, is pretty lame. The crafting system of hunting to get specific skins to build specific upgrade is also gone. Instead you'll sell skins for money and there are achievements (and, thus, perk points) for skinning a set number of each animal. The old system better rewarded you for playing the game the way you want to play it while making hunting feel like it mattered, and this system feels like a real step back.The weapon selection is also weirdly weak. It's broken up into categories, but you'll see multiple weapons in some categories with the exact same stats, like different models of an AK-47 and such. This is made even weirder by the game's gun customization options, which offers skins and attachments for everything. Why have two of the same rifle for sale in the menu? Why isn't one of them just a skin for the other? The arsenal feels light, as a result. Also, getting into a store seems to take an extra second or two, like it's hitting a server or something. Considering there are ""prestige weapons"" and other skins that you can optionally buy with a premium, real-money currency, maybe that's why it takes so long to get into the store. While some of the skins, vehicle paint jobs, and outfits are fun, Far Cry 5 is a first-person game. You barely ever see that stuff when you're playing the game.Far Cry 5 is, at times, very fidgety and glitchy. I ran into multiple quest-bearing NPCs who ran off mid-sentence and refused to activate again, forcing me to quit and restart. One such character was in the middle of telling me that he couldn't swim, then he got into an actively scared ""there's an enemy nearby"" state and immediately swam away. Pretty good form, too. One boss fight simply instructs you to kill the boss, so I pulled out my sniper rifle and smoked him. But he'll pop right back up, awkwardly, if you do it that way. You need to get up close so you can trigger a cutscene death. At one point in the game you're being constantly hunted by planes, but getting spotted by a plane doesn't activate enemies on the ground, so I was able to stealthily take over an outpost while also being bombarded and strafed from above. Characters flop around the environment, your AI helpers use their loud voices in stealth situations and sometimes use their stealth voices in open combat... while some of these glitches are funny and all, there are a few too many of them. They've been making these games for years, you'd figure some of this stuff would have been cleaned up a bit better by now.The game has a map editor and a whole separate mode called Far Cry Arcade that lets you share, play, and rate user-created levels and multiplayer maps. Some of the outposts and assault missions I've seen in these early days have been pretty good, and you'll earn some cash and perk points to take back into the campaign, but after 20 hours of finishing Far Cry 5 and messing around a bit with some arcade maps, I'm just not sure that I need an infinite array of mini Far Cry levels. The campaign was more than enough. The Arcade mode is well-made, though the competitive multiplayer doesn't feel great.A big part of the cult leader's final plea to you as the player is a large speech about how you're the real monster, running around the environment and murdering everything in your path. He even goes so far as to say that there are some problems that can't be solved with a bullet. But aside from a good ending/bad ending choice, a gimmicky fake early ending that was done better in Far Cry 4, and one or two minor points along the way, Far Cry 5 isn't a game about choice--unless you count the choice of which cult leader you're going to kill first. You might not be able to solve every problem with a bullet, but when the game only gives you bullets to work with, you aren't left with too many other real options. It seems like a dumb move on the writers' part to shine such a bright spotlight on how inflexible their open-world game actually is, but that's Far Cry 5. A decent video game undermined by bad pacing, weak characters, and a wishy-washy world view. Play it cooperatively with a friend, ignore the characters and their motivations, and you'll probably have a good time.The CHAMP and Jan are here to deliver news on The Last of Us Part 1 PC port, EA layoffs, PSVR2 reports, and more!© 2023 GIANT BOMB, A FANDOM COMPANY.

Far Cry 5,Ethan Gach,Kotaku,https://kotaku.com/far-cry-5-the-kotaku-review-1824076892,"I’ve spent a long time trekking across Far Cry 5’s fictional Hope County, Montana fighting the members of an apocalyptic cult led by a man called Joseph Seed, and I’m still not sure what their deal is. They drive around blasting weird Christian synth and shooting non-members on sight. It’s weird and terrifying and unsatisfyingly explored in this epic-length game. For all its nods to contemporary politics and societal strife, Far Cry 5 is just another fun permutation of the usual Far Cry formula with nothing very interesting to say.Ubisoft’s latest open-world first-person shooter depicts a society on the edge from the point of view of a small midwestern town cut off from the rest of the country. Creative director Dan Hay has said as much in interview after interview, stemming, he’s said, from anxiety following the financial crisis of the last decade. The game does try to clumsily tap into a pervasive sense in the real world that something’s got to give. In the game, we’ve got heavily armed Americans beginning to fight back against other heavily armed Americans. In real life, we’ve got Neonazis and Antifa brawling, endless polarization by the United States’ major political parties, worsening climate change and a dotard wandering the White House with access to the launch codes. Far Cry 5’s sense of the end times thus has a ring of truth to it, but the game has no idea where to take things from there.The game plays well, with you in the role of unnamed deputy (male or female, in a series first) fighting back against the cult. Its depiction of a growing resistance makes for a compelling mission flow, but it does a terrible job of integrating the extreme violence that makes it all work with the believable community of diverse individuals you spend the game getting to know. Far Cry stories have never lived up to their premise. Take the idea of a spoiled 20-something becoming a deadly killer overnight in Far Cry 3. That missed potential hits hardest with Far Cry 5. Joseph Seed is supposed to be a charismatic cult leader taking in those who feel alienated and left behind. At no point, however, did his supposed appeal come through in the game. He did not evoke the charisma of, say, the cult leader David Koresh, as played by Taylor Kitsch in the recent Waco miniseries that retold the infamous 51-day siege of a religious compound in Texas in 1993. For all his talk of economic anxiety and attempts to offer an alternative to the turmoil of modern politics, Seed’s arrival in Hope County and subsequent reign are fueled only by violence and fear. One of the game’s first characters, a Vietnam veteran named Dutch, is praised by others in the game as being one of the first to see through Joseph’s rhetoric. I can’t help but wonder what gave it away: the public displays of mutilated bodies crucified with rebar or the hordes of wandering “angels,” cultists who overdosed on Bliss and now have a penchant for bludgeoning people to death.It would be easier to forgive the game’s glib cartoonishness if it weren’t for all the work it does trying to invite comparisons to contemporary America real world. The game is keen to gesture whenever it can to America’s current political moment.The cigar smoking, rifle-cradling conservative Hurk Drubman Sr. (father to the long-running Far Cry character of the same name) asks you to help his campaign for state office by suppressing the vote. One of Joseph’s brothers, Jacob, is messed up from seeing wolves eat his buddy while lost in the desert during the first Gulf War. The game depicts an America infatuated with guns, a theme that proves disturbingly current. At the same time that the cultists worship at church armed to the teeth, there was an actual cult blessing their AR-15s weeks after one was used to commit a mass school shooting. Joseph’s sermons, played on the radio and on TV broadcasts, talk about the failure of politicians to fix what’s wrong with the country and the need to look inward for meaning in a world that cares only about profit. If the cult were real, Wolf Blitzer would have already interviewed its leader twice.All of the games allusions to real American problems, along with the generally mind-bending psychopathy of the cult, are at odds with the majority of what you see, hear and do in the game, the further you get from its cutscenes. The bulk of Far Cry 5 feels like gonzo camping trip that permeates the rest of the game. Yes, people are being kidnapped, tortured, and brainwashed, but in-between fighting to liberate the residents of Hope County from this b-horror movie plot, I also spent plenty of time skydiving, swimming, hiking, hunting, fishing, and rampaging through cedar forests on 4-wheelers at night like an idiot. I’d like to say this mix of the Huffington Post front page and a Bass Pro Shop catalog ends up being complementary, but it doesn’t work, with the split between ominous main plot and absurd side adventures feeling even more dissonant than in earlier Far Cry games. Far Cry 5 doesn’t have warring political factions or a well-defined protagonist’s descent into madness to help anchor its gamey patchwork of interlocking systems and over the top caricatures. There’s just you, a sheriff’s deputy with no backstory, motivation, or emotions of her own, negotiating one disorienting swing from hyper violence to charming absurdity after another. Away from the main plot and if you can ignore the potential for greater thematic complexity the setting presented, Far Cry 5 actually shines.After the opening cinematics and a short stint on a small tutorial island, the entirety of Hope County opens up. Recent Far Cry environments have been tropical, Himalayan or prehistoric. Far Cry 5’s are pedestrian North American landscapes full of pine forests, tall mountain ranges, and flat farmlands carved up by clear, winding rivers.This map, which publisher Ubisoft claims convincingly is bigger than any of the previous Far Cry games, is sliced into three regions, each controlled by one of Joseph’s siblings who you must assassinate in order to get to him. Doing so requires building up a “resistance meter” for each region by completing missions, rescuing hostages, and blowing up buildings controlled by Peggies (what locals have lovingly nicknamed the worshippers of the Seed’s cult, the Project at  Eden’s Gate). Filling up meters might sound boring, but here they’re a revelation. Instead of needing to follow a crumb trail of main story quests constantly bringing you into contact with Joseph you can effectively do whatever you want and have it contribute to the overall resistance effort. It’s a license to go out, explore, and have weird things happen free from the narrative constraints that bound previous games.Your map of the area starts off mostly shrouded in fog. As you explore more of it, collect maps, and complete objectives, sections fill in. You’ll learn, for example, that between these two hills is a person’s house and across the river is a gas station that needs to be liberated from cultists and converted into a place where you can shop for guns, cars, and helicopters. Re-capturing a landmark generally reveals characters who will offer new missions for you. Distractions are constant. A character may ask you to steal back their beloved semi-truck from enemy hands or find a missing pet mountain lion, and just as they end their sentence, a Peggie truck oil tanker may drive by. Blowing it up will help the resistance, so off you go. Once you’ve apprehended the vehicle, killed the driver, and either destroyed or looted it, you might even hear a cry for help from farther down the road or somewhere off into the woods. Two Peggies are proselytizing at someone tied up beside them, so you pick them off quickly with a couple of headshots, untie the person, and lo and behold they heard that their friend Hank who lives just down the road is about to get raided and so now you have to go check that out too. This is how missions cascade in Far Cry 5, all of which can be played in full co-op online, including the main story, a first for the series (although story progress only counts for the hosting player). Sometimes missions emerge conventionally. A named character asks you to go to a marker on your map and kill or bring back whatever’s there. Other times the missions seem to arise by accident. The game’s quest-givers, like its enemy patrol cars and emergent wildlife, tend to show up when you aren’t looking, rather than being pegged to specific locations.Then there are the infamous Far Cry anecdotes, a storytelling genre unto themselves, in which otherwise common game activities like killing everyone you see and blowing shit up lead to unpredictable outcomes. What had previously just been another side mission to check off of a list is transformed into something special, in part because it was somehow the culmination of events you the player set in motion. Far Cry 5 has those too, but its wide range of independent characters augments them in interesting ways.One night my character was getting bombed out of her mind in an abandoned campground turned drug lab on the southeastern edge of the map. An addict named Tweak was teaching me how to make “homeopathics,” the game’s potions, which included consuming them. In the middle of our research a plane started dropping bombs outside our cabin. Understandably freaked out, Tweak looked for cover in a shrub outside while I tried, my character’s vision blurred and motor functions impaired, to snipe the plane’s pilot from the ground. This was unsuccessful. Then trucks full of cultists pulled up at the entrance to the grounds, one with a mounted gun fixed on my my location. Near death and sprinting—a condition I’ve spent at least half of Far Cry 5 in—I climbed onto the roof of one of the buildings, aimed at the plane as it bore down on me for another strike, and chucked a stick of dynamite. Seconds later an explosion lit up the night sky. Another followed as the flaming wreckage slammed straight into armed convoy that had just shown up. It was a great Far Cry moment. As unwanted as the initial encounter was it ended up blossoming into something memorable, at least for me if not Tweak, my comrade who was happy to pick up our business exactly where it had left off. This kind of thing happened in other Far Cry games, too, but in this one it happens around characters I grew to care about. I like Tweak. He is weird. He lives in a hangout filled with mannequins posed just like people who once resided there. The walls of his lab are lined with phrases like “He lied!” and “I’m sorry!” scrawled in chalk. It’s creepy, as is Tweak’s upbringing, which unsent letters to his father will attest, but he’s turned to concocting medicinals to try and combat the effects of the Bliss on the community. I’ve been harassed by countless planes and helicopters while playing this Far Cry game, often out of the blue, but the ensuing firefights became a part of something much more interesting when they inevitably happened around characters I had learned to care about.Far Cry 5’s hired gun system, one that’s been evolving since Far Cry 2 and now includes animals like in Far Cry Primal, plays a big part in forging these connections to characters. There are nine major human or animal characters you can befriend and invite with you on missions, each with unique attributes. They range from a dog who can spot and fight enemies to a chatty pilot who provides air support. In addition, randomly generated characters you encounter in the world can be hired, though they’re not as useful and have less interesting things to say while traveling with you. At a basic level, it’s great to be trying to take down an enemy outpost and have someone watching your back who can revive you and also take out enemies you highlight with the direction pad. The system works flawlessly. There’s also an upgrade that allows you to bring two companions at a time, allowing you more avenues of attack and also providing an incentive to play the game on hard to keep things interesting. In terms of the game’s emergent story, however, having these hired guns also helps you build relationships beyond the original missions in which you met them. When I first encountered Jess Black, she was trying to get revenge on a cannibal, several hours later she’s saved my neck more times then I can count and her macabre personality seems a good fit for the carnage we witness together.""What if religion but too much.""Skydiving shoot ‘em upAll the people I met along the side of the road.Getting kidnapped by the game every so often and being forced to listen to bad poetry about the end times. Ubisoft MontrealPS4 (Played), Xbox One, PCMarch 27Around 35 hours on the main campaign. Five more playing around in co-op and Far Cry Arcade.There are limits to these interactions, and this is where Far Cry 5 shows its shortcomings in significantly evolving beyond its aging formula. Sure, these buddies seem more sentient than the average Far Cry character, but most of the people in this game world seem exceedingly clueless. Despite the atrocities going on around them, Hope County’s residents remain mostly chipper and good natured. This resilience often feels uplifting and humanizing. When I’m methodically skinning bears and mistakenly shooting civilians though, their continued solidarity and obliviousness of most of the game’s characters wears thin. Blowing up a van of prisoners invites a stern warning from the game not to kill innocents, but my neighbors barely react and don’t hold grudges long. Hired guns can be downed but they’re never out for long. One time I accidentally lit Jess on fire. She screamed in pain one moment, but was soon thanking me profusely when I revived her. At times like these, the game’s characters are more like the mannequins at Tweak’s campsite than believable people.The game has a streamlined player progression system that lets players unlock abilities by doing basic challenges like getting a set number of shotgun kills or gliding with the wingsuit for a specific length. The system is functional but short-lived and limited. One challenge involved killing and skinning five bison, so, in the interest of gaining more perks, I looked across my map for bison. My map had a marker for bison ever since I’d collected a magazine in a bunker nearby.  (Like just about everything in the game, from cult outposts to neighbors houses, hunting sites only appear as such once you’ve discovered them yourself or found a collectible noting the location.) I would find the bison in a  field just off the side of the road next to a river. I pulled out my .50 caliber and got to work. Two shots a piece. Of all the game’s varied wildlife, the bison are some of the easiest to kill. A wolverine hiding in the tall grass nearby caused more trouble than all of them combined. Unlike in previous games, animal parts aren’t used for crafting in Far Cry 5. Instead, gun enhancements are bought outright, and animal skins are collected to satisfy the requirements of specific quests or just sold for cash. I killed a lot of animals in the game, as is par for the course in every Far Cry. In Far Cry 5, however, it’s connection to American outdoorsmanship somehow makes it feel more self-indulgent and evil. After all, here I am with military-grade weapons bringing to the ground with relative ease not just one or two but eight bison and counting. I got three more than I needed because even though the pained groans of a bison are unsettling, their hides fetch $200 a piece and the 1911 Extended pistol I’d been coveting costs a small fortune.After skinning their corpses, I saw some camping equipment not far off by a downed tree. There I found a small abandoned backpack, toolbox, and cooler upon which sat a note, from no one in particular, which read: “A baby bison is called a ‘red dog’ because the people who name things lack basic education. Also, humans slaughtered 50 million of them. 50 MILLION!” With one cutting bit of flavor text the game made me feel like an asshole for trying to use the systems it had put in place to develop my character. It also hinted at a legacy of real world violence the game is content to mine for moral significance and weight without doing much to tackle it head on. No one in Hope County will pop out of the woods to chastise you for poaching or call your methods into question. Violence is simply the way of things, and as in past games, Far Cry 5 isn’t interested in calling that into question beyond the occasional subtext or poorly conceived monologue spoken by someone with no room to point fingers.On January 23, 1870, Colonel Eugene Baker led a raid on a camp of Blackfeet Native Americans in Northern Montana. His soldiers killed some 37 men, 90 women, and 50 children for, admittedly, no reason other than that the Montanans were afraid of them. Now dubbed the Marias Massacre, The New York Times called it a “shocking affair” at the time, while the New North-West of Deer Lodge, Montana countered that these critics were simply “namby-pamby, sniffling old maid sentimentalists.” While the occasional note in Far Cry 5 might grapple with this past, the game’s characters refrain from engaging in complex debates around American history, gun culture or religious fundamentalism. It would have been a richer game if it at least mined its setting for more than cultural knick-knacks designed to be the butt of some joke. Nearly every corner of Hope County oozes a sense of patriotic bravado, only this time it’s aimed, barrels loaded, at a sect of religious extremists. Notably, hardly anyone ever talks about trying to persuade some of the cultists to leave Joseph’s “flock,” and there’s no way to capture or subdue any of them. Every attack is lethal. This, I suspect, is partly why Bliss figures so heavily into the lore of the cult and what they derive their power from. It helps erase any ethical gray area. Racial tensions, sexism, and actual political disagreements are similarly paperped over in the game. Everyone in Hope County who isn’t a Peggie gets along fine for the most part, making it even more unbelievable that a death cult would have found it so easy to take root their in the first place. Where Joseph’s apocalypticism offers an obvious opportunity to dig further into the actual political divisions which might afflict place like Hope County, Far Cry 5 uses it mostly for ominous effect and narrative head-fakes.Early on I thought Far Cry 5 might actually plan on grappling with these demons, the ones its villains seem engineered to manifest in uniquely American ways. Maybe Joseph and the Peggies were symbolic of some sort of punishment for the country’s larger failings beyond Hope County. The more I played, though, the more I realized that’s not the case. Far Cry 5 is a flashier iteration of the past games whose newfound relationship to reality is really just another sideshow.One of the main attractions, long term at least, is likely to be the game’s Far Cry Arcade. It offers a more robust level editor than past games which you could spend hours sinking time into constructing maps and missions to be shared with other players online. Perks, items, and cash you earn during these missions carry over into the main game, and although the existing Ubisoft ones are vanilla at the moment, I’m confident players will eventually construct custom death traps even better than what’s in the main game, not to mention whenever the Far Cry: Battle Royale mode inevitably arrives. It’s a development that fits in perfectly with Ubisoft’s games-as-service strategy, but one that only further dilutes the impact and weight of the game’s main story. Arcade machines and posters throughout the world invite you to go play the game’s eccentric multiplayer stuff. “I could play this all day,” characters standing over the machines say, despite the gunships constantly flying overhead.Far Cry games are laboratories for experimenting, giving you the freedom to do stuff ordinary games won’t, like throw a molotov cocktail at just about anything and watch it burn to the ground. They usually have better shooting than most open world games, and better open worlds than most shooters. Far Cry 5 nails that part of the series’ legacy. The game’s missions flow together organically and let you shift from capturing a cult outpost using an array of explosives and guns to scaling cliffs in search of hidden caches of equipment and lore-filled collectibles. It fails, however, to meaningfully move beyond the rest of the series in merging the violence and chaos these experiments produce with the community of people scattered throughout its world. These are still silly worlds full of silly people and no amount of gravitas about the world being on the edge can be sustained in a game that so frequently sends you into hunts for cow testicles or stunt races set to the theme song of a retro daredevil. The series has always struggled with this dichotomy. It’s only fitting that after several games subjecting fictional populaces from the global south to this confusion it arrives in America’s backyard. The boldness of this decision, however, isn’t backed up by the lackluster story or simplistic fight for liberation taking place on the ground."
Far Cry 5,Mike Williams,USgamer,http://www.usgamer.net/articles/far-cry-5-review,"Ever since Far Cry 3, Ubisoft’s open-world series has been about the bad guys.  These charismatic antagonists take top billing on the box art, and they taunt you across the entire adventure. Next to your protagonist  - who’s usually as likeable as a men’s rights activist - they bleed personality.Far Cry 5 takes this formula to its natural conclusion: now there are four antagonists and the main character is a fully customisable mute. Hooray! As an unnamed deputy, you head to Hope County, Montana, to arrest an enigmatic cult leader known as Joseph Seed. The Seed family run a religious group called the Project at Eden’s Gate and have laid siege to rural America, rounding up civilians, torturing, and maiming - all in the name of God. Hallelujah. Of course, the arrest goes awry, fulfilling a prophecy Joseph predicted and embedding the cult’s beliefs - martyring Joseph without killing him. Radio contact is cut off from the outside world, you are alone, and Hope County has completed its transformation into Fascist Fields.  
 
Hope County is split into three regions - the Henbane River, Holland Valley, and Whitetail Mountains - and each of these regions is overseen by one of Joseph’s trusted advisors: John Seed lords over Holland Valley, Faith Seed enraptures the Henbane River region, and Jacob Seed instills fear into the people of Whitetail Mountains. "" Weapons have a real impact to them, and guns recoil like a bucking bull - every shot is angry and physical.""Each of the Eden’s Gate leaders has their own methods: John Seed is the cult’s lawyer and rules by intimidation, Faith Seed controls the population through a drug called Bliss, and Jacob Seed recruits frontline soldiers by culling the weak. Only you and your star-spangled assault rifle, your canine companion, a couple of bears, a cougar, resistance fighters, your wingsuit, some air support, a garage full of vehicles, a flamethrower, a bow, lots of explosives, and a combine harvester can stop them. These multiple antagonists represent a structural shift for Far Cry 5. On the tutorial island, an NPC asks you to climb a radio tower. When you reach the peak, he explains that you don’t need to worry - he won’t have you climbing towers all over Montana. Instead of unlocking the world by clambering up vantage points, you discover points of interest by simply exploring: drive past a cult outpost and it will be on your map forever; talk to a rescued civilian and they might point you to a sidequest; free companions and they will offer up more activities. Far Cry 5 is still as stuffed with things to do as other Ubisoft games, but it never feels overwhelming because of the way it unfurls. There are no progress gates, and you can spread your time between the three regions as you wish. Everything you do - be it stealing a fuel truck, burning a Bliss field, saving citizens, doing side missions, or taking on one of the more lengthy story quests - it all feeds into a progress bar for the antagonist of that region.  
 
Each of the Seeds must be drawn out by messing with their operations, every third of the bar triggering a big story mission. When I played Far Cry 5 at preview, I wasn’t sold on this structure. It felt confusing and I ended up doing a lot of the filler missions instead of getting to the meat during my short playtime. In the context of the full game, however, it works - even if it can be a bit grindy as you slowly plug away at filling the final third of each bar.Mission quality varies, but the good outweighs the bad. Stealing bull testicles as Marvin Gaye’s Sexual Healing plays over the action is a highlight. Fighting a demon moose who has been pumped full of drugs is not. Luckily, the core of the game feels stronger than ever. Weapons have a real impact to them, and guns recoil like a bucking bull - every shot is angry and physical. There’s just enough auto-aim snap on console to make you feel like a sharpshooter as well, whether you are flipping between targets in an outpost or sailing down a zipline with an uzi, gunning down cultists as you go. Likewise, vehicles feel great to drive. You can get behind the wheel of a big rig and smash through roadblocks, or you can speed across dirt roads in a muscle car, its back-end fishtailing angrily with every push of the accelerator. Once you are done with the roads, you can take to the skies in helicopters and aeroplanes, strafing compounds and performing bombing runs. Or you can jetski and boat across the Henbane River.  
 
All three regions have their own distinct personality, too. For example, the Henbane River region is difficult to traverse by car because it’s so hilly and the river itself divides the landmasses like a liquid artery. Take to the air and it comes into its own. Holland Valley, meanwhile, is best explored on four wheels, smashing through fields and barreling into cows. The unpredictability of the world keeps things fresh. ""There are some surprising bits of social commentary nestled in among the stereotypical hillbillies, survivalists, righteous priests, and alien hunters.""Spreading fire is as much a part of Far Cry’s identity as bad guys gurning into the camera, because fire is indiscriminate. Far Cry smashes loads of components together, placing warring factions, animals, and the elements into the map and letting you manipulate them all. Far Cry 5 hasn’t done much to improve the series here - other than let you play the entire thing with a co-op buddy, upping the unpredictability - but watching your plans unfold as you become the AI puppetmaster is as intoxicating as ever. At least until you are almost murdered by a turkey. Tonally, Far Cry 5 is a strange game. There is no getting away from the real world climate it released in. Here you are, saving the northwestern US from a cult of Christian extremists, diplomacy fails within the first five minutes, and the only answer to all of your problems is a gun.  
 
In the lead up to release, Ubisoft made it clear that Far Cry 5 had no political statement to make, but there is no escaping the context it released in. Despite those apolitical claims, some of the dialogue is overtly political, too, though probably not in the way you might expect. At one point, one of the cult leaders breaks into a monologue about their motives, asking you if you’ve seen the way the world is, if you’ve seen who is in charge, if you’ve seen the wars, if you have seen the walls being erected. Far Cry 5 does have a message, and that message appears to be: the world has gone to shit, and people act desperate when pushed, particularly if they have embedded belief systems. There’s also a lot of hand-wringing about violence and how you are as bad as the cultists for resorting to murder to solve Hope County’s issues. It’s a bit cliche, but there are some surprising bits of social commentary nestled in among the stereotypical hillbillies, survivalists, righteous priests, and alien hunters. I just wish there was more of it. Ubisoft did lots of research to make sure Eden’s Gate has a believable cult structure, but it’s not explored enough in-game. I wouldn’t even know John Seed was a lawyer if I hadn’t read the information elsewhere. Despite being the main attraction, the bad guys just don’t get enough screen time. Still, Far Cry 5 is an interesting game to play in 2018, and it’s easily the best the series has been since Vaas asked us if we knew the definition of insanity in 2012. Also, I’m well into religious music (and Marvin Gaye) now. You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

Jason Faulkner 
Far Cry 5 has been making waves in the world of video game writing since it was announced at last year’s E3. Instead of being set in a fictional approximation of a random third-world country, Far Cry 5 takes place on American soil in Montana. The plot this time around looks to hit fans a lot closer to home, and instead of dealing with a single madman’s antics, you’ve got to face down a whole cult.Hope County, Montana needs a savior, and you’re the only one that fits the bill. As an unnamed deputy sheriff (everyone just calls you “Rook” because you’re the rookie cop on the squad) you’ll have to liberate Hope County from the clutches of Joseph Seed’s Project at Eden’s Gate cult. So, most of you who read this are likely dying to find out about the political content. Does Far Cry 5 make a scathing critique of “Trump’s America” and the alt-right, or does it criticize the left?Both sides of the political spectrum are likely frothing at the mouth over the opportunities for “hot takes” Far Cry 5 presents, and I’m sure there’ll be plenty of them, regardless of whether there’s anything substantive there to comment on. My take away from it is that any political commentary the game makes is absolutely skin deep, and the only message here is “cults are bad.”Joseph Seed and troupe don’t really fit on the US’s political spectrum, mostly because for all the bickering people here still talk about their problems for the most part. Instead, the Project at Eden’s Gate is like a larger, more violent but less sexually abusive version of the Branch Davidians, with Joseph Seed playing the role of David Koresh.The Project at Eden’s Gate is your typical doomsday cult, but instead of doing a Waco, Joseph and his siblings Jacob, John, and Faith have decided to turn Hope Valley into their own personal little fiefdom. Anyone who doesn’t willingly join the cult is either murdered or forcibly converted through torture or drugs (or both). Joseph thinks he has been chosen by God to protect his “children” and lead them to Eden’s Gate so that humanity can return to the Garden of Eden.Unfortunately, as intriguing as the background for Far Cry 5 is, the way its narrative structure is set up means much of it is wasted by weird pacing. All open-world games to a certain extent have issues with inspiring a feeling of urgency, and the more open a game is, the more you’ll find the main story taking a back seat to exploration, side quests, and collectibles.Far Cry 5, for better or worse, is the most open game in the series. After a brief tutorial section at the start, the entire game world is unlocked for you. Previous Far Cry games have usually had a “northern” and “southern” section, with one of them blocked until later in the game, but not this one.Hope County is split into three sections, each of them controlled by one of the Seed siblings. John Seed controls Holland Valley; Faith Seed uses the swamps and springs of the Henbane River region to grow the flowers needed to produce her mind-controller BLISS drug; and last, but not least, are the Whitetail Mountains, which are controlled by Jacob Seed and used as a training and staging ground for the Eden’s Gate armed forces.You can take on these three regions in any order or even move between them at will. This is where the narrative issues come into play though. Each region has a “Resistance Meter” you have to fill to progress in your attempt to take down one of the siblings. Almost everything you do fills the Resistance Meter a little. Rescuing civilians, taking down large cult outposts, or assisting locals in their story or side missions will all add little chunks to the meter. Once it hits a milestone, you can take on a unique story mission concerning that region’s Seed sibling. Each of these milestone missions builds a narrative that concludes in a showdown with the sibling and the “liberation” of an area.The problem with this kind of story progression though is how uneven the tone of the game becomes. With no way of knowing how you’re going to play through the Far Cry 5, you’ll rarely find any callbacks to game events outside of whatever region they took place in. Even when you’ve just crawled out of the swamps at the beginning of the game, everyone treats you like a hero, and the only permanency that exists in the game comes from taking down the Seed siblings.Even when they’re gone though, regions stay mostly the same. The Eden’s Gate cultists still roam around doing whatever, and the locals will still offer their questlines like nothing happened.There also seems to be some subtext for a, “are we as bad as the cultists,” subtext to the story (by “seems to be” I mean that some random NPCs basically ask this question to the air when I walk past them). If the writing was any more subtle, or if the cult wasn’t so completely insane and evil there might be some fruit to that train of thought, but the obvious answer to that question is, “absolutely not.”The cultists kidnap, torture, mutilate, brainwash, and murder people with impunity and the fight against them is entirely justified. However, the game continues down this train of thought by having the Seed siblings defending their actions to you and exposing the unfortunate events that happened to them in the past. I won’t ruin it for you, but nothing that happened to them gives any justification for the cult’s actions or what they’ve done in Hope County.I’m not sure if the writers were trying to get you to sympathize with the Seeds with their little monologues or just trying to show how delusional they are, but I just didn’t care. The Seeds are portrayed as too brutal and megalomaniacal to take seriously, and it ended up making the work that went into their personalities and backstories meaningless. A better tack would be to make the whole crew more “benevolent dictator” and confront the player with a situation in which the Seeds might very well be right or actually trying to do the best for their fellow man. Instead, they’re so clear cut evil that their motivation is irrelevant, and it’s undeniable they’re wrong.The uneven feeling extends throughout the various aspects of the game. I was never sure whether I was supposed to be horrified by what was going on or giggling, or what. Here are some examples of just how jarring the game’s tone is:Far Cry 5 sets itself up to be somewhat of a pseudo-horror game with some of the creepy, violent, sinister stuff the cult does but then injects out of place awkward humor. It’s like one team made the main plot with the Seed family and the cult and they were told to make a horror game, and another group did the dialog for the ordinary citizens and sidekicks and were told the game was a comedy.Luckily, the gameplay is pretty fun. There’s a ton of cars, boats, helicopters, and airplanes to operate, and Hope Country is varied enough geographically to keep boredom from slipping in. There are plenty of side activities to do as well. I enjoyed fishing and hunting for “Prepper’s Stashes,” which are caches of items that usually involve solving a small physical puzzle to access.One thing I ran into was that there was sometimes too much going on. I might be trying to rescue a civillian I found in a van while heading to a Prepper’s Stash when suddenly cultists and Resistance members begin descending onto my position and fighting each other. After we win the firefight, the person I rescued tells me about a cult outpost, and I forget all about what I was doing in the first place.Like the plot though, I wish that the side activities too were more interconnected. Instead it all feels like a bunch of tiny distractions. Even side missions and some story missions just feel completely detached from the rest of the game. They tend to depend too heavily on “go here and kill this” as well instead of being comprised of unique gameplay experiences.You don’t get a vast arsenal to choose from in the first place. The guns are split among a few categories like Pistols, SMGs, Rifles, Sniper Rifles, and Special Weapons. Unfortunately, there’s only a few to choose from in each class, not counting the prestige weapons that are just unique versions of the base weapons in the game. Ghost Recon Wildlands had a great weapons system and an excellent selection of guns and attachments, and I wish this game were comparable.The choice of firearms represented in this game is also somewhat strange. This is rural Montana, so you would expect a lot of hunting rifles and shotguns. However, for some reason, the most common gun in Hope County is some fictional variant of an AR-15 type rifle called the AR-C that fires in single, burst, and full-auto. How everyone in Hope County got ahold of a modern, full-auto assault rifle is beyond me. Apparently, Montana gun laws are relatively lax, but I’m pretty sure the importation of thousands of fully-automatic rifles would raise some flags somewhere.The guns you think would be more common, bolt-action .308 rifles, .22s, .38s, and so on are rare or non-existent. Instead, you get Uzis, Tech 9s, .50 anti-material rifles, and other guns that are rare in civilian hands. Ubisoft could have used the Montana setting to add a ton of guns we don’t usually see in games, and shy away from the guns-blazing, full-auto rampages we typically see in FPS games, but instead the arsenal is pretty equivalent to what we’ve seen in previous Far Cry games.The gunplay itself in Far Cry 5 is OK most of the time. It suffers from the same syndrome that many FPS games do in that most (if not all) of its firearms feel incredibly anemic. Both when it comes to hunting animals (one of the side activities and a way to get skins to sell) and fighting cultists, most pistols, the SMGs, and lower caliber rifles feel like you’re just shooting puffs of air. More powerful guns like the .50 snipers rifles and the .44 Magnum also feel incredibly underpowered.Not only do the guns not feel powerful in the sound and effect of firing, but they also end up doing much, much less damage than they would in real life. As Far Cry 5 goes on and you face higher ranking cultists, they just become bullet sponges, which takes a lot of the fun out of the game. There’s nothing less immersive than shooting a cougar in the head with a .308 rifle five times and watch it run away.There are microtransactions in Far Cry 5, though I’m not sure why. You can purchase silver bars for real money, or find small amounts in safes scattered throughout Hope County. You can use these silver bars to buy prestige clothing, weapons, and vehicles. I’m not sure why you’d want to though. You can also buy all these things for the in-game currency, and being that, for the most part, they’re just variants of regular items, they’re not even that useful.I suppose microtransactions could give you a boost early in the game, but that’s mainly just taking the fun away from yourself since Far Cry 5 is so single-player/co-op campaign-centric. The whole silver bar system feels very much like an afterthought and I really never thought about it during my entire time through the game. In fact, I never spent the silver bars I found during the course of Far Cry 5 because none of the gaudy prestige items interested me at all.The drop-in multiplayer co-op in Far Cry 5 has been a highly touted feature, and it works well. If there’s one thing Ubisoft has in the bag, it’s that they’ve got some of the best working drop-in multiplayer in the industry. It’s easy to invite a friend to your game, and once there you can both play as usual. You do have to stick pretty closely together, with the host player being the anchor for the player who joins. Roam too far as second banana, and you’ll respawn right back next to the host. However, other than that limitation, you’re free to drive, fly, or shoot just as if you were playing the game single-player.Co-op is one place where the game’s mission structure is a boon. Being able to hit the game in small bites instead of long story bits makes it a lot more convenient for multiplayer. Far Cry 5 lends itself well to being played in quick 20-30 minute chunks, with the mission structure providing plenty of good stopping points. It makes for good co-op, and if you’re someone that doesn’t have a ton of time all at once to complete a game, you may appreciate it.Far Cry 5 Arcade is a mode that lets you play user-created maps in solo, co-op, or multiplayer capacities. This game ships with a robust map editor on all platforms that includes assets from Far Cry 4, Far Cry Primal, Far Cry 5, Watch Dogs, Assassin’s Creed Unity, and Assassin’s Creed IV Black Flag. Theoretically, this gives the game unlimited replay value, though the maps present are far smaller than a full-fledged campaign.Since the game hasn’t been released yet, there’s not much available to play yet, but the sample maps did give a taste of what’s possible with the editor. One of the single-player/co-op maps I played was a recreation of a Waterworld atoll (with the possible loadouts referencing The Mariner and The Deacon) with the mission of clearing out enemies. Another simulated a prison break, and I had to fight my way out of the jail to freedom.The PvP multiplayer maps left a bit more to be desired, and I don’t feel like Far Cry 5 is very well geared to deathmatch-style gameplay. However, it really comes down to what the community does with the editor on whether Far Cry 5 Arcade will be good or not. It’s kind of a gamble on whether to buy the game based on this feature. On the one hand, if a lot of people pick it up and start making cool maps, it might be a game you don’t put down for months. However, if people just ignore the editor, you might find yourself just playing the single-player campaign without much of a glance at Far Cry 5 Arcade. Given that map editors are so rare on console games though, Ubisoft gets some kudos for bringing that option to PS4 and Xbox One.This game was all over the place regarding quality. There are some things I really like about Far Cry 5, and others I just think are awful. If the story had been told in a more linear, coherent way I think it would have been much better. This game almost gives you too much freedom to the detriment of cohesive gameplay design. Each thing you do has so little effect on the rest of the game world that it feels futile. The only bonus from this is that it facilitates co-op gameplay well.Part of what made me disappointed in this game was that I bought into the hype train. I thought that the Seeds were going to be a lot more interesting than they really were, and I expected a story that had a unique spin. If you liked the other Far Cry games, you’ll like this one, because it’s more of the same. Some of the series conventions have been taken away (like having to climb towers, thank God), or improved, but it’s still very much a Far Cry game.This review is based on a PS4 digital code provided by the publisher.7Jason Faulkner is the Senior Editor of Game Revolution and PlayStation LifeStyle.

Far Cry 5,Raymond Porreca,Destructoid,https://www.destructoid.com/review-far-cry-5-495917.phtml,"darkHope County is heartbreaking. The stretch of Montana country is beautiful but racked by tragedy; a region of breathtaking views marred by the violent and vengeful grip of a doomsday cult called Eden’s Gate. That clash of bucolic, frontiersman-like Americana and end-of-days gloom brought on by the cult informs every aspect of Far Cry 5 but also highlights some of its biggest shortcomings. Far Cry 5‘s opening sequence establishes a dark tone. As the junior deputy on a mission to arrest Joseph Seed, the leader of Eden’s Gate, players arrive at the commune’s base woefully outgunned. Seed stands in his chapel, preaching to those gathered of society’s failings and imminent collapse right up until the moment the deputy places him in handcuffs. It’s a tense few minutes after that, as players escort Seed back to a helicopter as his flock begins to close in. Eden’s Gate is powerful, seemingly unstoppable, and with their leader threatened, it’s no surprise that the cult is quick to action. Members throw themselves onto the helicopter willingly, as if their only purpose in life was that single action, and send it hurtling to the ground. Before long, Seed is free, and the deputy takes up arms to stop the cult once and for all.Far Cry 5 (PC, Xbox One, PS4 [reviewed])Developer: Ubisoft MontrealPublisher: UbisoftReleased: March 27, 2018MSRP: $59.99Although Far Cry 5‘s first hour conveys a sense of urgency, it quickly falls in line with the series’ established framework. Hope County is a playground dressed up as an inviting, albeit chaotic, environment. The ongoing threat of Eden’s Gate always looms overhead — it’s hard to go a few minutes without running into a dozen armed cultists — but players can distract themselves by fishing, hunting, and exploring the map just as easily as they can work towards taking Seed and his family down. There’s plenty to do, and while Montana might not sound like the most exotic or exciting location on paper, there’s even more to see.But by throwing players into an open-world sandbox, Far Cry 5 casts its narrative direction by the wayside. Although your goal is to kill Seed’s three generals (one in each of Hope County’s different biomes) before capturing the cult leader, the storytelling quickly takes a backseat.The game’s more interested in joking about Seed’s man bun than exploring Eden’s Gate with a critical eye, opting to paint the cult in broad strokes as a group of vague zealots and torturers than an organization built on the backs of broken people. And while the scattershot storytelling doesn’t make the game any less fun to play, it makes for an experience that feels toothless rather fast — Seed and his lot are easier to understand as cartoonish villains spouting rhetoric than characters capable of complexity, all the way up to the game’s final cutscene.Fortunately, Eden’s Gate cultists aren’t the only people you’ll meet in Far Cry 5. Hope County is also home to a small grassroots collection of rebels and freedom fighters. Among them are nine (six humans, two wild animals, and one Very Good Boy) characters who can accompany The Deputy into the wilderness and provide support. Each one of the partners has a unique set of skills that complement varying playstyles, like Nick Rye, who uses his agile plane to strafe and divebomb enemies. AI buddies often get a bad rap, but they’re mostly all useful here, especially considering that Far Cry 5 isn’t afraid to overwhelm players at any given moment. And though it’s not uncommon to be up against a dozen foes at once, firefights are where Far Cry 5‘s sandbox structure shines. During both main story missions and open-ended play, Eden’s Gate cultists have a bad habit of fighting dirty. They’re armed to the teeth and unafraid of calling in reinforcements, be it waves of fresh fighters or aerial support. Even with a partner or two, surviving large-scale fights isn’t a guarantee. It’s best to prepare before assaulting a cult outpost, though even the stealthiest approach tends to go tits up, leading to shootouts full of explosions, near-death escapes, and absurdly high body counts. Gunplay in Far Cry 5 is feverish and enjoyable, with customization and a steadily unlockable arsenal that allows players to mix up engagements however they see fit.There’s something deeply satisfying about approaching a guarded camp with a recurve bow and silently picking off enemy snipers. There’s something cathartic about tossing remote-controlled explosives at a cult VIP and rushing in with a shotgun to clean up anyone left standing. But there’s nothing better than starting a gunfight and reacting with fury in the form of a few well-placed headshots. Violence is Far Cry 5‘s primary language, and if nothing else, the game speaks it well.With so much combat, it’s only natural to seek some quiet respite. Hope County, with its mix of forested mountains and rolling rivers, offers plenty of pretty scenery to soak in. It’s hard not to be impressed by the environments, which balance the beauty and brutality of the American wilderness in a way that few games have before. Reaching the summit of a steep peak, tracking down a doomsday prepper’s long-forgotten supply stash in an underground bunker, and wandering through a park dedicated to prehistoric mammoths are just a few of the poignant, quiet moments that make Far Cry 5 worthwhile when the shooting stops. It’s possible (and recommended) to take a break from the action, turn off the game’s HUD, and wander around in the woods for a while. That Far Cry 5 lacks a photo mode is a crime.Far Cry 5 is a solid first-person shooter set in a vibrant, breathtaking location. It plays well, looks great, and is packed with enough content to keep players invested in Hope County for a good, long while. Though Joseph Seed and Eden’s Gate work better in theory than in practice, the Montana-based doomsday cult marks a departure for the franchise that pays off.[This review is based on a retail version of the game provided by the publisher and pertains to the core single-player story. An in-depth report on Far Cry 5‘s Arcade mode and online features will be available later this week.]GoodSolid and definitely has an audience. There could be some hard-to-ignore faults, but the experience is fun.

Far Cry 5,Erik Kain,Forbes,https://www.forbes.com/sites/games/2018/03/27/far-cry-5-review-just-say-yes/,"'Far Cry 5' is beautiful mayhem.Far Cry 5 is one of those games that was always bound to be controversial, largely thanks to Ubisoft's decision to set the game in Montana with an extremist cult and its creepy leader as the antagonists.Hope County, MT has come under the sway of Eden's Gate, a bizarre doomsday cult with a penchant for ultra-violence, vague religiosity and a drug called Bliss. You, the rookie Sheriff's deputy, are the one-man (or woman) army who, with a little help from your friends, is here to take them down and put an end to this reign of terror.Along the way you'll meet a bear named Cheeseburger, a dog named Boomer, and a whole bunch of good, god-fearing, red-blooded Americans willing to risk it all to help---or just send you on various side missions, from retrieving bull testicles to assisting in the construction of an interplanetary teleportation device.Far Cry 5 is both a chaos simulator and a dark journey into America's very own heart of darkness. The story is preposterous. The gameplay is brilliant.As a born-and-bred Montanan, I find the portrayal of Montana beautifully ludicrous. I certainly don't remember quite so many Southern accents up there in the Northwestern mountains and prairies---Montana accents can range from pretty standard West Coast American to something a bit more Midwestern/Great Lakes-ish, but I suppose there's some hillbilly in there, too---and the state is overall much less racially diverse than Far Cry 5, though it has many more Native Americans than are represented in the game.One must choke down their suspension of disbelief to accept the game's premise. Yes, there have been cults and militias in America and they have presented difficulties to law enforcement and some of these cults have ended in violence and bloodshed. But we're talking about a cult thousands strong, armed with fighter planes and rocket launchers. The cult has taken total control of an entire county, stealing property, murdering or enslaving innocents and running roughshod over this rural American county like the Taliban in Afghanistan.No, this is not likely to happen in the US. Long before it could ever get this bad the feds would crack down. If it did somehow get this bad, the army would intervene. It's just not at all realistic---but who cares? This is Far Cry. I played the game imagining this was an alternate version of America, one with even more brittle institutions and a very weak federal government. One without cell phones, for that matter. One in which Eden's Gate could actually take over and nobody would come to help. Nobody but the Rookie, that is. I mean, why not just enjoy the fantasy, however absurd, rather than worry about how unrealistic this game in a deeply unrealistic series is? If I can accept this twisted version of the my home state, so can you...Thi s is my Rookie. I gave him a mullet, made him Native, and dressed him up like a true Montanan.Fun Times In BabylonThe open-world of Hope County, Montana is a sight to behold. Whatever the game lacks in story it makes up for in adventure, variety and gameplay. When a co-worker emailed me the other day to ask how I was liking the game, I simply wrote back: ""I love it to pieces.""This is certainly the best Far Cry since Far Cry 3, but in many ways I'm enjoying it even more. For one thing, it's just a lot of fun. I know that's not a particularly deep observation, but it's the truth. I've been playing the hell out of this game and I've been having a blast the entire time. I'll tell a few stories to help illustrate my point.During one story mission, I went to steal a plane for one of the main NPC characters, Nick Rye. Completing this mission unlocks Rye as a gun for hire. He'll fly the skies and take out enemy planes for you, freeing you up to wreak havoc on the ground unmolested.The plane was located at John Seed's ranch. John is one of the top lieutenants of the cult, managing one of three major sections of the map for his brother Joseph Seed, the Father. (The other two sections are controlled by Jacob and Faith Seed.) When I show up, I discover that the ranch is also one of the cult's outposts. Like in past Far Cry games, capturing these bases is one of the main activities in the game. So I decide to forego the plane mission and take the base. I start out pretty sneaky but give up part way through to destroy the final of three alarms with a rocket launcher. All hell breaks loose and I barely manage to take out the remaining bad guys, accidentally lighting myself on fire with my flamethrower. My NPC companion revives me and I finish off the final cultist with a rocket that sends him flying fifty feet into the air. You can watch this all in the video below:Another time I was running through the forest when I came upon a small campground. A man was seated playing a Bob Dylan song. A man and a woman stood dancing by the fire. It's little moments like this that really make the game feel alive---or at least more alive than many similar games.Tonal DissonanceThe FatherThere's also the quest I went on to retrieve bull testicles for the annual Testicle Festival. Or the one where I helped a conspiracy theorist straight out of the X-Files build a teleportation device that actually worked, leaving me with a snazzy new weapon in the process.These are coupled with missions where we learn about the atrocities of various cult members, including one cultist who made starving children eat their own parents after burning them alive. These tonal pivots are extreme, no doubt about it, but this is what we've come to expect from Far Cry as a series. Extreme violence, madness and cruelty are juxtaposed with humor and bombast. It's a far cry from realistic, but as a game it still somehow works.I've seen some people complain that the game doesn't send a clear enough political message or that its shifting tone is hard to follow, but I think this is what makes this series tick. Contradictions are at the heart of Far Cry and now those contradictions are just much closer to home.Many people have also complained that Far Cry 5's political and social commentary is too watered-down and too vague to be of any particular consequence. It's not relevant to modern-day America or strident enough in its condemnation of things certain people feel the need to condemn. The cult's belief system is opaque and barely touches on radical Christianity or radical conservatism or what have you. And it's true: This isn't a condemnation of ultra right-wingers, though I do think it's a critique of radical beliefs in general. The cult may be impossible to pin down due to Ubisoft playing it safe with the religion and politics, but I think the point is that Eden's Gate is emblematic of all kinds of radical, violent extremism. It's not like radical Islam or rightwing terror groups make any sense, either.But this certainly isn't a condemnation of conservatism. Indeed, most of the good guys are red-blooded Americans wearing flags on their T-shirts. I've never seen so many American flag shirts in my life. But I do think the game has a message, even if it's one that isn't all that applicable to the here and now of US or Montana politics.Far Cry 5 evoking True Detective.Scottish political philosopher Edmund Burke famously wrote that “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.”He also wrote, ""No man, who is not inflamed by vain-glory into enthusiasm, can flatter himself that his single, unsupported, desultory, unsystematic endeavours, are of power to defeat the subtle designs and united cabals of ambitious citizens. When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall, one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle.""I think this pretty perfectly sums up what this game is all about. Good citizens stood around and did nothing while bad men and women took control of their home. It may seem silly in the context of modern America with all our checks and balances and power and wealth, but this sort of thing is far from unprecedented. I mentioned the Taliban above. Eden's Gate is like a very generic American Taliban. The citizens of Hope County let them take over and then finally, with the help of one super soldier (young Rookie) fought back. The only thing necessary for Joseph Seed to take over was for good men to do nothing, and in the end ""the good must associate; else they will fall, one by one, unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle.""Indeed, one wouldn't have to look all that closely at current happenings in Washington, D.C. to see some parallels. Even our illustrious Republic and its Constitution are not immune to corruption, to 'united cabals of ambitious citizens.' Good people of every political stripe need to stand up to political corruption, warmongering and nepotism at all levels of government. There's even one mission in the game that's all about gerrymandering...Changes to the FormulaFar Cry 5's Montana is truly beautiful, just like the real thing.Far Cry 5 makes some solid gameplay and quality of life improvements as well. Gone are the silly towers that you once had to climb in order to unlock portions of the map. ""I know what you're thinking,"" your first quest-giver tells you as he asks you to climb the radio tower. ""Don't worry, I'm not going to make you climb towers all over the county."" Now you just find maps which you can later sell for cash.Gone are the multiple health bars, also. Now you just have one. You can use medkits to heal, but over time you'll heal without them. Gone, too, is the constant picking of flowers. The only potions you craft are totally optional. Medkits have to be purchased or found. Pickable flowers are far more rare. And with all these omissions, tedium is also vastly diminished.Gone, too, is the requirement to hunt and skin animals to progress. You can still do that and earn rewards for it, including useful bait and valuable skins, but you don't need to seek out specific animals in order to level up your pouches and gear. Now everything is based on ""perks"" which you can earn by doing...well, just about everything. Get ten kills with this weapon, get a perk. Get five kills with that weapon, get a perk. Go base-jumping, get two perks. Crash your plane, get a perk. Then use all these perks to level up your various skills.If you want to just go out in search of perks, there are myriad 'prepper' stashes dotted across the map. Each one is a mini-puzzle of sorts that requires you to figure out how to get inside and find the treasure---money, goods and three perk magazines that give you one perk each. This means that pretty much no matter how you play, you'll be earning perks as you go. You can even go and see what activities will earn you perks and do those---for instance, changing up which weapons you use is a sure way to earn perks faster and get you trying out different guns.But really, you can just play and not even think about it. You'll earn perks and level up at a nice pace regardless.A familiar face.Missions, meanwhile, flow much more organically than in previous games. Pretty much everyone in the game has something to offer. Rescue a citizen on the side of the road, maybe they'll tip you off to some side mission or character you need to meet. Capture a base and you'll almost certainly have a side mission, a prepper stash tip and possibly a story mission open up. You can do these in just about any order you like, though obviously certain story missions need to be done before others open up.Ubisoft has certainly taken some of what they implemented in Ghost Recon: Wildlands and applied it here. The format of the map is incredibly similar, and as with Wildlands you'll need to keep provoking the boss of each section into action. Poke the bee's nest enough and the cult will stir into action against you, eventually leading you closer and closer to each of your primary targets. The whole thing can play out in any order, and you can spend as much time on side missions and other side content as you like in the process, or just race through the game.Online/ArcadeThe game is fully playable in online co-op which is another nice feature for anyone wanting to delve in with a friend. Meanwhile, the online portion of the game takes place in Far Cry Arcade, where you can play solo, co-op or PvP depending on the maps you choose. The Arcade is also a really full-featured map editor which I haven't played with at all yet. I've played some of the Arcade maps, but mostly spent my time in the sprawling campaign.One clever twist here is that to access the Arcade you actually have to go to arcade machines dotted about Hope County. It's a nice touch. I'll play around with the map editor and all of this more and write it up in a future post.Good doggie.Micro-TransactionsMicro-transactions in full-priced video games with paid DLC are bad. Plain and simple. All these big AAA games with loot boxes just smack of greed. But at least in Far Cry 5 the MTX don't have an impact on the game itself. Basically you can use real money to purchase silver bars (which you can find in the game also) which you can then use to buy gear in shops. You can also just spend in-game cash on these same items. None of them have any impact on gameplay. You can also purchase outfits with silver bars or in-game cash. That's it, basically. You can just ignore these altogether or spend some cash on items if you really have to. No loot boxes, nothing on offer that you can't just buy after playing the game.VerdictFar Cry 5 isn't a perfect game. Some missions are certainly less fun than others. I encountered a couple difficulty spikes that had me more frustrated than challenged. The sheer scope of content can be a bit bewildering and overwhelming at times. And the lack of a clear message certainly indicates that Ubisoft was not willing, not brave enough perhaps, to take more of a stand.And yet, for all that, this is some of the most fun I've had gaming all year. The game is gorgeous and rich with content. There's tons to do and you can do it however you like. Scale a mountain and go base-jumping with your squirrel suit. Try to crash your plane into an enemy outpost. Unleash predators on unsuspecting cultists. Blow stuff up with glee and abandon. Pet your adorable dog, Boomer. This freedom, coupled with the game's excellent quality of life changes, make this a wonderful first-person shooter sandbox game that will appeal to anyone who enjoys freedom in gameplay and doesn't mind an outrageous story.Of course, I have my own biases. I've loved every Far Cry game including the original (though Primal was a bit weaker, and I didn't play that much of Far Cry 2. It's on my list of games to return to and play more thoroughly.) These games just click for me---they don't for everyone. I'm glad to see the series make some changes, also. Far Cry 3 was great, but Far Cry 4 didn't try to differentiate itself enough and that made it feel a bit too repetitive. Far Cry 5 is certainly more of the same thing, but with enough changes that it feels fresh.I give the game a Buy on my Buy/Hold/Sell scale. I think it's worth the price of admission. If you get the Gold version you get a copy of the remastered version of Far Cry 3 as well, which is a great deal (though I haven't yet played the remaster so I can't comment on its quality.)I played my copy of the game on a PS4 Pro on both a TV supporting HDR and one without HDR. The game is stunning on my LG OLED screen with HDR but looks quite nice on a regular 4K television as well.Far Cry 5TL;DR: Far Cry 5 is a chaos simulator with a preposterous story, tons of quality of life improvements over past games and an enormous amount of content. It's a blast if you let yourself just accept the silly premise and not invest too much in the politics of the game, or lack thereof.Developer: UbisoftPlatforms: PS4, Xbox One, PCPublisher: UbisoftRelease Date: March 27th, 2018Price: $59.99 / $30 Season Pass / $89.99 Gold w/Season PassScore: 9/10A review code was provided for the purpose of this review.And here's some more gameplay footage for your viewing pleasure:"
Far Cry 5,Bill Lavoy,Shacknews,http://www.shacknews.com/article/104144/far-cry-5-pc-review---fear-and-lore-in-hope-county,"New to Shacknews? Signup for a Free AccountAlready have an account? Login NowFar Cry 5 surprised me in a lot of ways, some pleasant and others not so much.By the time my law enforcement colleagues and I arrived to take The Father, Joseph Seed, into custody, Hope County, Montana, had been consumed by his Eden’s Gate followers, known to the locals as Peggies. The situation was dire, and I felt a chill the first time I saw his compound. The Father, the game’s main antagonist, reminded me of David Koresh, who was the leader of the real-world Branch Davidians. It was a narrative tone that I wasn’t expecting, but it was welcome. Soon, however, the unsettling mood set by the prologue gave way to the fast-paced, non-stop action that open-world Ubisoft games are known for.When I was eventually set free in Hope County, I spent about half an hour being introduced to the various concepts and mechanics of Far Cry 5. I found a prepper stash, had the chance to swim, used a zipline, and even hired an NPC to help clear the game’s first region, Dutch’s Island. Once through that, I was free to go where I wanted and do what I pleased.After clearing Dutch’s Island, I picked up a quest to liberate a lumber mill, so I set off on foot with my hired NPC fighter in tow. I generally don’t like to fast travel in open world games, but I didn’t even drive to this mission. My immediate goal was to get a feel for Hope County. It looked gorgeous on my PC in 2K, and I wanted to get lost wandering around the woods and mountains. The first thing I noticed beyond the beauty of Hope County were the sounds that brought the world to life. Be it the burst fire from assault weapons over the hill, the creepy voice of a cultist over the radio, or the hissing of a snake I couldn't see but knew was close, sound was as essential to survival in Far Cry 5 as it was to my enjoyment in the game.Unfortunately, the temptation to enjoy outdoor life in Far Cry 5’s stunning environment was contradicted by the density of the game’s dangers. I couldn’t go five feet without being fired on by Eden’s Gate, or mauled by a bear. This sometimes lead to hilarity, but there were few, if any, quiet moments in the early going where I could stop and enjoy the world. My first attempt to go fishing was met with violence, and hunting isn’t really hunting when you need an automatic rifle to defend yourself from your intended prey. I used both activities almost exclusively to earn money in the early going, but eventually I was swimming in cash and had no gameplay incentive to return to either.The lumber mill mission also turned out to be my first outpost, and those generally worked the same as they did in Far Cry Primal. Each one had numerous enemies, an alarm or two that needed disabling, and some loot and lore could be found once the baddies were gone. Liberating these outposts gave control of it back to the non-cultist citizens and opened it up as a base that I could operate out of. There was always a shop to buy guns, ammo, and items, and usually a vehicle bay or two. Liberating an outpost also presented additional side missions and allowed me to hire wandering NPCs to fight by my side.I enjoyed everything about outposts in Far Cry 5. The fighter I hired on Dutch’s Island helped me clear the first one, and I was pleased to see that I could give him orders with a single button press. If I tagged an enemy and then sent my fighter after them, he’d try to use stealth to take them out. We cleared the first outpost without being detected, and it was nice to see that the area was now back in the hands of the good folks of Hope County. The more outposts and locations I cleared, the less influence Eden’s Gate had, which led to a true feeling that I had liberated the region.As satisfying as clearing an outpost was, though, a major mechanic was missing. Far Cry 5 doesn’t have the option to go prone, and it worsened my experience with stealth gameplay. Ubisoft perfected going prone in Ghost Recon Wildlands and Rainbow Six Siege, and I think that made the lack of a prone mechanic here sting even more. I realize it wasn’t an option in previous Far Cry games, but I don’t get the design decision.Prone notwithstanding, combat was enjoyable. I used a DualShock 4 controller even though I was on PC, and I never took issue with the button layouts, even with vehicles. The control scheme always felt intuitive, and this helped to keep the flow of combat moving. I was never fumbling around trying to figure out what to press. Switching weapons and tossing explosives was effortless, and all of this tied into the weapons and perks in Far Cry 5.Getting weapons and gear in Far Cry 5 wasn’t satisfying. Beyond the Compound Bow I found during my time on Dutch’s Island, everything was purchased through vendors. I felt robbed of the need to look for a sniper rifle or assault rifle. Gear acquisition became boring. Some weapon upgrades were locked behind progression, which was fine, but for the most part I found the system unrewarding. Even finding the bow was less exciting once I realized I could have just paid for it.Perks also fell a bit flat for me. There were a few that were useful, such as the Grappling Hook or Lockpick, but beyond that most were forgettable. When I finally finished with everything I wanted to do I was only missing a couple, and I didn’t bother to read their descriptions before spending the points to unlock them.Earning the points to unlock the perks was the best part of the system for me. Perk magazines (each worth one perk point) could be found in prepper stashes and unlocked through gameplay. The few times I needed a perk I knew I could quickly earn the required points by catching a new fish or using a weapon I’d been ignoring. Perk points were also awarded for kills that fighter and specialist companions racked up, which pushed me to give each one a try.Fighters and specialists enhanced the combat experience of Far Cry 5. The former are regular NPCs that you bump into. They each come with two unknown perks that are revealed and unlocked after they get a certain number of kills. They can be hired or let go as desired, and you can have three on your roster at any one time. I ended up with two I found useful, but the third spot became a revolving door of fighters who didn’t fit in. Since I could mix and match specialists and fighters, and can only ever bring two at a time, this wasn’t a huge deal.The nine specialists were all unique characters that unlocked after the completion of their related mission. Each comes with different perks and personalities, and it’s when they start to interact with each other that things got fun. Nick would compliment Jess, while Hurk would tell her stories and call her “lady girl” constantly. Jess would insult Hurk. These interactions were a subtle touch, but they made me want to try different combinations of specialists to see what crazy things they might say to each other. My favorite was when Nick and Jess would be tagging along, and because Jess favored the use of a bow, Nick would chime in with, “I tried hunting with a bow once. That shit’s hard.”The main appeal of a companion was the violence they brought to the table. In the early hours of my playthrough I would take Jess and Boomer with me. Boomer (the dog) would mark enemies, and Jess (killer with a Compound Bow) would take them out silently. It worked well with my preference for stealth, and it was also effective for hunting wildlife. Slowly, though, I found myself preferring to travel Hope County by helicopter. I grew tired of violent encounters every few steps and used air travel to avoid distraction. This is about when I switched to Nick and Adelaide as companions. Nick flew a plane and could strafe or drop bombs, and Adelaide provided the comedic tone and overwatch in her chopper. Together, we decimated Peggies and could clear outposts and missions in minutes. This built up the resistance in each region and progressed the story at a good pace.The concept of clearing out Peggies and building a resistance in each region worked well. What didn’t work was how often Far Cry 5 interrupted me and dragged me into a story mission. The moment I would level my resistance in an area, one of the Seed siblings would capture me, ripping me from whatever I was doing. Once I could handle, but this occurred half a dozen times. It annoyed me enough that I logged out after leveling my resistance one night. I was exploring prepper stashes and had no desire to be dragged into another mission at that moment, so I put the game down in frustration.It wasn’t that I didn’t find myself invested in the narrative, but collectibles and getting into prepper stashes were my favorite parts of Far Cry 5. Prepper stashes were usually bunkers that required me to solve a small puzzle to gain access. I was addicted to these from the moment I realized they existed and managed to find each prepper stash long before beating the game. My only issue was the use of waypoints everywhere. There was one prepper stash that gave me a waypoint that said “Find.” That sort of sucked the fun out of things. I did discover that I could tweak the HUD and gameplay settings, but this was long after it would have helped me.Some prepper stashes, bunkers, and buildings in Far Cry 5 reminded me a bit of Fallout 4. In that game, each destination told a story that I could easily overlook if I wasn’t taking my time. Far Cry 5 had the same feel at times, which is the highest compliment I could give it considering how much I enjoyed Fallout 4. I’d often find that, when I slowed myself down and really paid attention, there were stories being told in Hope County that I could have just as easily walked right past. Hope County was full of lore, but I often found myself too busy ticking the boxes on the waypoint checklist to notice.Far Cry Arcade was the last mode I tried. I loved the idea of designing single player, co-op, and PvP experiences with assets from previous Ubisoft games. However, I was quickly overwhelmed with what was before me and lost interest in building anything. This was more a reflection of my lack of creativity, though. The concept of building new gameplay levels and scenarios by using thousands of assets is interesting, and it could add longevity to Far Cry 5.Next, I jumped into some Far Cry Arcade PvP. Through my five or six games, I was underwhelmed by what I found. Weapon loadouts were limited, the gameplay didn’t stand out from anything I’d played in the past, and I couldn’t find a reason to want to return. It could have been fun with friends and chatting on the mic together, but I played with random gamers. Nothing about the PvP experience sold me on coming back to it. PvP just doesn’t interest me much these days, and nothing in my rounds of PvP threatened to pull me back to it. I’m a co-op man at heart, which brings me to my biggest complaint.Co-op in Far Cry 5 was amazing to play but terribly implemented. I loved playing with a friend and seeing how combat evolved. I recall cruising down the road, him driving and me hanging out the window with a baseball bat, crushing the face of anything that got close. It was mailbox baseball with a twist, but the fun in co-op never stopped as long as we were insane enough to try something.The problem was when I left his game and returned to my own. I kept my perks, cash, and weapons, but story progression was lost. We probably went through a dozen missions, only for me to return to my game and have to do them all again. How this slipped by the game’s designers or was considered a good idea is beyond me. Co-op was the single most anticipated feature for me leading up to Far Cry 5, but I began avoiding it because I didn’t want to repeat quests in my own instance.Far Cry 5 was a good game that could have been great. Had Ubisoft not been so concerned with holding my hand, or overwhelming me with clutter to keep me from getting bored, Hope County would have gone down as one of the better open worlds I’ve stepped foot in. The  game’s narrative was a great idea that turned out better than I expected, but the value for me with an open world will always be in how much I enjoy existing in it. How motivated am I to explore and discover? With Far Cry 5, there were hints of that, but all too often I was shown the answers. This left me feeling slightly robbed of how I experienced things.At the same time, Far Cry 5 met all my expectations for exciting combat and hilarious moments. Whether grappling from my helicopter because a random NPC jacked it, or hearing Adelaide discuss why she stocked up on olive oil before Eden’s Gate took over, there were more moments of hilarity and brilliance than not. A few things missed the mark that shouldn’t have, but I generally got what I expected from Far Cry 5; a fun, open-world game worth the price tag and not to be taken too seriously.Bill, who is also known as Rumpo, is a lifelong gamer and Toronto Maple Leafs fan.

					Really? This is the best one in the series, no question. I haven't read that review, but everyone I've heard from has loved it.				
					Well, in reality much has not changed or improved. It's just a neat, well executed package. In general, a person who does not enjoy FC games will not enjoy this one, nor will a person who is burned out on the formula. This is coming from a fan of the series who DOES think 5 is the best of the bunch, but that doesn't make it worth 60 bucks. It's pretty safe as far as sequels go.				
					Agreed, it's more of the same (not that that's a bad thing).				
					[deleted]				
					I have Far Cry 5 and Arse->Arse Creed Origins...I keep going back to Origins.				
					I'm playing through the Ass2AssRogue remaster and will wait until the price for FC5 drops.				
					I haven't played that yet. I feel like when I get some down time from games to play I should put some effort into that.				
					Primal was pretty bad. This feels much better. But it fails to step into the elite open-world games category like The Witcher 3, BoTW (I'm told), or Fallout 4.				
					Man that is a motley crew of games.  FC5 is nothing like the Witcher or BotW and Fallout 4 doesn't deserve to be in the conversation. FC5 is simply a more refined version of FC3/4 in a brand new setting.				
					Every Bethesda game is going to be in a conversation of open world games whether you recognize it or not bill.				
					Primal was bad in the sence that there was no real story because everyone just talked cave man bs. But I think I enjoyed the gameplay more than farcry 5. Throwing spears at shit was so satisfying				
					Unintelligible cave man grunts would be much preferred to Far Cry 5's story heh				
					So why *did* Adelaide stock up on olive oil?				
					It wasn't for cooking, although she notes that it can be used for that as well. :)				
					Too much hand holding through the HUD? Did I turn that off or something, because I don't recall any of thatI started the game by turning all hud options off, then quickly turned it back on, maybe doing that turned off a tutorial?				
					I'm with you on a lot of the lack of progression and discovery when it comes to mechanics.  After the first few hours you never find new weapons, you only buy them, and there are few upgrades or even significant variations within a category.				"
Far Cry 5,Kirk McKeand,VG247,https://www.vg247.com/2018/03/26/far-cry-5-review/,"Ever since Far Cry 3, Ubisoft’s open-world series has been about the bad guys.  These charismatic antagonists take top billing on the box art, and they taunt you across the entire adventure. Next to your protagonist  - who’s usually as likeable as a men’s rights activist - they bleed personality.Far Cry 5 takes this formula to its natural conclusion: now there are four antagonists and the main character is a fully customisable mute. Hooray! As an unnamed deputy, you head to Hope County, Montana, to arrest an enigmatic cult leader known as Joseph Seed. The Seed family run a religious group called the Project at Eden’s Gate and have laid siege to rural America, rounding up civilians, torturing, and maiming - all in the name of God. Hallelujah. Of course, the arrest goes awry, fulfilling a prophecy Joseph predicted and embedding the cult’s beliefs - martyring Joseph without killing him. Radio contact is cut off from the outside world, you are alone, and Hope County has completed its transformation into Fascist Fields.  
 
Hope County is split into three regions - the Henbane River, Holland Valley, and Whitetail Mountains - and each of these regions is overseen by one of Joseph’s trusted advisors: John Seed lords over Holland Valley, Faith Seed enraptures the Henbane River region, and Jacob Seed instills fear into the people of Whitetail Mountains. "" Weapons have a real impact to them, and guns recoil like a bucking bull - every shot is angry and physical.""Each of the Eden’s Gate leaders has their own methods: John Seed is the cult’s lawyer and rules by intimidation, Faith Seed controls the population through a drug called Bliss, and Jacob Seed recruits frontline soldiers by culling the weak. Only you and your star-spangled assault rifle, your canine companion, a couple of bears, a cougar, resistance fighters, your wingsuit, some air support, a garage full of vehicles, a flamethrower, a bow, lots of explosives, and a combine harvester can stop them. These multiple antagonists represent a structural shift for Far Cry 5. On the tutorial island, an NPC asks you to climb a radio tower. When you reach the peak, he explains that you don’t need to worry - he won’t have you climbing towers all over Montana. Instead of unlocking the world by clambering up vantage points, you discover points of interest by simply exploring: drive past a cult outpost and it will be on your map forever; talk to a rescued civilian and they might point you to a sidequest; free companions and they will offer up more activities. Far Cry 5 is still as stuffed with things to do as other Ubisoft games, but it never feels overwhelming because of the way it unfurls. There are no progress gates, and you can spread your time between the three regions as you wish. Everything you do - be it stealing a fuel truck, burning a Bliss field, saving citizens, doing side missions, or taking on one of the more lengthy story quests - it all feeds into a progress bar for the antagonist of that region.  
 
Each of the Seeds must be drawn out by messing with their operations, every third of the bar triggering a big story mission. When I played Far Cry 5 at preview, I wasn’t sold on this structure. It felt confusing and I ended up doing a lot of the filler missions instead of getting to the meat during my short playtime. In the context of the full game, however, it works - even if it can be a bit grindy as you slowly plug away at filling the final third of each bar.Mission quality varies, but the good outweighs the bad. Stealing bull testicles as Marvin Gaye’s Sexual Healing plays over the action is a highlight. Fighting a demon moose who has been pumped full of drugs is not. Luckily, the core of the game feels stronger than ever. Weapons have a real impact to them, and guns recoil like a bucking bull - every shot is angry and physical. There’s just enough auto-aim snap on console to make you feel like a sharpshooter as well, whether you are flipping between targets in an outpost or sailing down a zipline with an uzi, gunning down cultists as you go. Likewise, vehicles feel great to drive. You can get behind the wheel of a big rig and smash through roadblocks, or you can speed across dirt roads in a muscle car, its back-end fishtailing angrily with every push of the accelerator. Once you are done with the roads, you can take to the skies in helicopters and aeroplanes, strafing compounds and performing bombing runs. Or you can jetski and boat across the Henbane River.  
 
All three regions have their own distinct personality, too. For example, the Henbane River region is difficult to traverse by car because it’s so hilly and the river itself divides the landmasses like a liquid artery. Take to the air and it comes into its own. Holland Valley, meanwhile, is best explored on four wheels, smashing through fields and barreling into cows. The unpredictability of the world keeps things fresh. ""There are some surprising bits of social commentary nestled in among the stereotypical hillbillies, survivalists, righteous priests, and alien hunters.""Spreading fire is as much a part of Far Cry’s identity as bad guys gurning into the camera, because fire is indiscriminate. Far Cry smashes loads of components together, placing warring factions, animals, and the elements into the map and letting you manipulate them all. Far Cry 5 hasn’t done much to improve the series here - other than let you play the entire thing with a co-op buddy, upping the unpredictability - but watching your plans unfold as you become the AI puppetmaster is as intoxicating as ever. At least until you are almost murdered by a turkey. Tonally, Far Cry 5 is a strange game. There is no getting away from the real world climate it released in. Here you are, saving the northwestern US from a cult of Christian extremists, diplomacy fails within the first five minutes, and the only answer to all of your problems is a gun.  
 
In the lead up to release, Ubisoft made it clear that Far Cry 5 had no political statement to make, but there is no escaping the context it released in. Despite those apolitical claims, some of the dialogue is overtly political, too, though probably not in the way you might expect. At one point, one of the cult leaders breaks into a monologue about their motives, asking you if you’ve seen the way the world is, if you’ve seen who is in charge, if you’ve seen the wars, if you have seen the walls being erected. Far Cry 5 does have a message, and that message appears to be: the world has gone to shit, and people act desperate when pushed, particularly if they have embedded belief systems. There’s also a lot of hand-wringing about violence and how you are as bad as the cultists for resorting to murder to solve Hope County’s issues. It’s a bit cliche, but there are some surprising bits of social commentary nestled in among the stereotypical hillbillies, survivalists, righteous priests, and alien hunters. I just wish there was more of it. Ubisoft did lots of research to make sure Eden’s Gate has a believable cult structure, but it’s not explored enough in-game. I wouldn’t even know John Seed was a lawyer if I hadn’t read the information elsewhere. Despite being the main attraction, the bad guys just don’t get enough screen time. Still, Far Cry 5 is an interesting game to play in 2018, and it’s easily the best the series has been since Vaas asked us if we knew the definition of insanity in 2012. Also, I’m well into religious music (and Marvin Gaye) now. You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

That’s not to say that Far Cry 5 is all bad. Once I packed up my last shred of hope that the game had anything interesting to say (which happened about 30 minutes in), I was able to uncover some genuinely smart changes to the series’ increasingly stagnant gameplay formula.The game is set in Hope County, Montana, and for the first time in a long time, you won’t need to reveal the lovely looking locale by scaling towers. Ubisoft has finally put away that stale gameplay structure, which once belched thunderclouds of mind-numbing objectives onto the map every time you got to the top of a lookout. The result is definitely an example of addition by subtraction.In Far Cry 5, all but a few side and primary objectives crop up organically. On your mission to stop a vaguely menacing, vaguely Christian cult that’s taken over Hope County (the evocatively named “Project at Eden’s Gate”), you’ll run across hotspots of activity just by exploring. The biggest of these mimic the classic “outposts” that have shown up in the series since Far Cry 2. Once you clear out an outpost, it becomes a hub of non-player characters that can join your bloody quest—or simply chatter about other minor activities.The freeform progression through the map doesn’t just occur at outposts, either. Say you catch some cultists carting citizens off to be brainwashed, or shake a grizzly off a lonely hiker. Your reward is most often a single new quest on the in-game map rather than the explosion of map icons found in many other Ubisoft games. This makes the map feel much more manageable, and the change reduced that usual Far Cry feeling that I was just checking objective boxes.Sadly, fatigue with the new formula does eventually set in once you start hitting up those slowly revealed points of interest. While Far Cry 5 finally stretches the series structurally (after the rehash of FC4 and the obvious filler that was Primal), it still doesn’t know how to fill in all the space it covers.Said space is split into three zones, each ruled by a different lieutenant of the omnipresent doomsday cult, each with their own agenda. Despite those differences, you mostly perform the same handful of activities throughout all three regions without much stress or variation save for occasional reskinning. The evil self-help guru’s land is packed with silos full of drug-infused fertilizer that you need to shoot until they explode, for instance. Meanwhile, the organization’s seemingly psychic “little sister” has filled her territory with tiny, drug-filled chapels that you need to… shoot until they explode. What variety!The homogeneity doesn’t end there. Ubisoft has further streamlined the Far Cry formula by removing crafted upgrades and experience points. Now, every new ability comes from “Perk Points” accrued by completing cookie cutter challenges: killing 20 enemies with SMGs, killing 20 enemies with shotguns, or killing 20 enemies with pistols, and so on.As such, Far Cry’s checklist-y malaise has shifted from exploration to progression. I never felt like I was working towards making my mute meatball protagonist stronger by playing skillfully to earn headshot and stealth XP bonuses. Instead, I was just letting progression happen to me. From time to time, I’d just happen to see a pop-up saying I had more of whatever generic juice let me unlock a wingsuit or grappling hook for no narrative reason whatsoever.The one upside to this system is that Perk Points can be acquired from Far Cry 5’s “Prepper Stashes.” These micro-dungeons are by far the game’s standout addition and shake up gunplay that hasn’t changed since Far Cry 2 with some much-needed puzzle-platforming.Longtime series fans might recognize some of the stashes’ gameplay ideas as being borrowed from Far Cry 3 and 4’s now-removed towers. But without that rigid architecture defining what they can and can’t be, Ubisoft was free to go to town with all manner of spatial puzzles. One very quick stash, for example, simply required me to snipe a keypad through a window across a lake. Another held a series of grappling hook swings over a boiling underground lake. One other had me scale the inside of a tower while maneuvering around hives of angry bees.It’s almost disappointing that every stash terminates with a fat stack of cash and a handful of Perk Points. It’s a reminder that these wonderful diversions are in service of the rest of the game’s unremarkable whole—some very occasional hits among a whole lot of misses.The list of gameplay misses includes the aerial combat: sluggish, simplistic dogfights in propeller planes. Disappointments also include stunt driving challenges in unwieldy cars you can barely see from in the game’s enclosed first-person view.I still get a low-level hum of enjoyment from clearing outposts, but these feel so much more easily surmountable than they did in past games. Maybe it’s the fact that Far Cry 5 has automatically regenerating health, removing the disgusting urgency of pulling bullets out of my avatar’s arm to heal. Maybe it’s just that I’ve been at this for three games now (four, if you count Primal) with nearly identical weapons and tools at my disposal. Maybe it’s just my imagination. Whatever it is, that sense of satisfaction has definitely been diminished.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

Far Cry 5,Chris White,God is a Geek,http://www.godisageek.com/reviews/far-cry-5-review/,"March 27, 2018.It’s been a while since I’ve played something as constantly chaotic as Far Cry 5. There’s a lot of shooting, a lot of mayhem, and a lot of Peggies. What’s that, you ask? It’s one of Joseph Seed’s followers, hellbent on blowing you to kingdom come by any means necessary. Whether you’re driving to the next checkpoint, wandering around in the open, or chilling in the Fall’s End arcade, there are few places you can go to entirely escape the action. I love the gameplay here, especially when you’re in a plane chasing down a convoy or heading into an outpost to gun down part of Seed’s flock. It can be a bit much sometimes, and even though it can be a whole lot of fun, the consistency of each threat on your life is overbearing at times. That said, in the moments of solitude you can’t wait to get back into the thick of the action. It’s a special kind of burden, believe me.I’m going to go on record here to say it’s one of the best of 2018 so far, and the best Far Cry game I’ve played. It’s a typical Ubisoft game in many ways, but it’s a stripped back Far Cry, and that’s a good thing. There’re no radio towers (well, there’s only a few, with one including the Ubisoft’s nod to our frustrations with them), the maps aren’t massively overpopulated with things to do, and side quests to take on, hunting is only used as a tool to sell the items you scavenge, and the story doesn’t take a backseat. Joseph Seed is a fascinating villain, surpassing the insane Vaas from Far Cry 3, bringing a layered and troubled character to the masses. His family are equally interesting, as is the world of Hope County. It’s a wonderful place to explore, and there are some fantastic locations to visit. The map is separated into three parts with each one under the control of Joseph’s siblings. John Seed oversees Holland Valley, Jacob is up north in Whitetail Mountains, and Faith takes care of Henbane River. Each character is superbly written: John relies on the word of God and the power of the word “yes”; Faith uses Bliss (a drug that causes hallucinations) to manipulate and confuse; whilst Jacob is a war veteran that forces you into battle and pushes you to the limit.You can take on the regions one at a time, or flit from one to another and complete the story missions out of sequence. There’s a certain level of structure, but you’re much freer to explore and undertake them whenever you want. With a story so dark, many were worried that it would lose significance, focus, and impact, but throughout each of the three locations, you become dazed and end up being transported to an interaction with each of the siblings that involves a certain mission. Faith tries to turn you to the cult, Jacob will put you in a time-based battle, and John tries to get you to confess your sins, followed by a tricky escape. These encounters add plenty of depth to the story, and remind you just how twisted this family is between all the gunfire and destruction.The game is made up of story quests, along with Outposts to liberate, civilians to save, Shrines and Silos to blow up, and more. There’s lots to do, but not too much to feel overwhelming. Each one has you do something different, whether that be taking to the skies in a plane to destroy a convoy, driving around in a beast of a vehicle to wipe out Peggies, or unlocking one of the 9 Guns for Hire. These include the likes of Nick Rye – an expect in the sky, Hurk Drubman JR. – an Alan from the Hangover type character, and Sharky Boshaw – a pyromaniac with a penchant for Disco Inferno. These missions bring some of the humour to an otherwise dark tale, and they are a pleasant parallel to the otherwise darker tones.Another part of these extra quests includes Prepper Stashes. These are caches that require you to solve a type of riddle to find, and once located they hold plenty of cash, ammo, and craftable items. Almost every quest gives you Resistance Points, and once you’ve reached the maximum number of Resistance Points for that area, you get to take on one of the three siblings. One of the newer features is fishing, and it’s surprisingly fun, giving you something extra to do whilst exploring the gorgeous world of Hope County.It can be easy to get to the different locations with the right vehicle, and thankfully there’re plenty to choose from. Helicopters, seaplanes, trucks, and cars can all be unlocked and bought. I often chose the same helicopter for most missions, but you can’t just spawn them anywhere. Strongholds have spawn points and shops, and liberating outposts can become bases for the Resistance. With this, spawn points for all vehicles come with them, along with shops for you to buy new weapons, ammo, and outfits, along with consumables like medkits.There are some great weapons you can buy, and custom weapons from fallen foes can be unlocked once you defeat them, but for the most part I stuck with the same sniper rifle and semi-automatic. Enemies are easy to kill, with the occasional heavy taking a bit longer to down. This is great because you never struggle massively but the further in to a region’s story you get, the concentration of enemies get higher, as do their airplanes and helicopters.There is plenty of freedom to how you go about your way. The more damage and chaos you cause, the more you’ll find the enemies come for you. You could drive around Hope County and every enemy will come for you, but if you take them out stealthily, less noise is created, and you won’t be in as much conflict. It’s a smart mechanic, and one you can manipulate to make things easier for yourself. The thing is, you’ll just want to blow shit up because it’s so damn great. Rocket launchers, remote explosives, and dynamite do loads of damage, and firing on enemy outposts with rockets decimates them. You could go in and take them down by snapping their neck, but where’s the fun in that?Far Cry 5 is a blast, with a great story that always hammers home the reason why you’re there, doing the things you’re doing. The ending has just as much impact as the journey, and Joseph Seed and his three siblings are the best written characters Ubisoft has ever featured in a Far Cry game. Many may feel the constant chaos is a bit much at times, but there is peace amongst the violence. Some may miss hunting being such a big part, but instead of doing it for crafting purposes, you do it mainly to sell at shops for more money. It isn’t necessary for progression, so it feels better to do in your own time.There is a Perks menu, and there’re plenty of great attributes and tools to unlock. You can get a parachute early on, or a wingsuit. The repair torch allows you to repair any vehicle, or you can improve your health, proficiency with weapons, or how efficient your stealth is. There’s plenty to focus on, and again, your freedom to play around remains until the end. There’re certain challenges you complete by using certain weapons or killing specific animals, and each one provides you with more Perk points, so along with earning them in other ways you end up with a fair few.Co-op is magnificent, and I had hours of fun playing through the game this way, too. The only issue is a lack of progression if you join a friend’s game. Say you complete three story missions together, those missions still need to be completed when you head back into your own game. You do get to keep any money or perk points, but an option to have progression carry over would’ve been nice. Far Cry Arcade is another element to Far Cry 5’s online features. In it, you can create your own maps or play through others, eventually including content from other Ubi titles like Assassin’s Creed and Watch Dogs. There’s not a lot there now, but after release I’m sure this will have heaps of potential.The music is another outstanding element, whether it’s the orchestral score by Mark Yaeger, or the hymns written by Dan Romer that tell the story of Joseph and the cult. There’re also tons of licensed music by bands like Eels, The Vines, and T-Rex. Some missions even have songs play to accompany them, and they add much more excitement. One of the missions is called Get Free, and when that kicks in, I was in my element.I love Far Cry 5, and I’ll keep on playing to finish every side-quest I missed, then I’ll be back for the DLC. It’s one of those games where you don’t want the story to end because of how gripping it is, while the supporting cast of characters is a great mix of troubled, bizarre, and amusing folks. Oh, there’s a bear called Cheeseburger that can become one of the Fangs for Hire. This game has it all, and it’s never boring, regardless of the time spent with it. Fantastic characters
Complete freedom to play how you want
Gorgeous locations and great music
Co-op can be a blastCo-op story progression doesn't carry over
Combat can be too constant at timesThe best Far Cry yet, with well written characters, lots of freedom to play how you want, and a lot of fun to be had on your own or with a friend.

Far Cry 5,William Schwartz,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/far-cry-5/,"Over the past few installements, Far Cry has carved out a unique identity for itself (Let’s forget Primal for a second).  The series has tried, and mostly succeeded to push an evocative narrative by introducing us to some of the most psychopathic villains in games.  All the while sending players out in a massive open world to explore, giving them the freedom of choice to play the game the way that they want to.  In these regards, Far Cry 5 isn’t going to be a huge surprise as it continues to iterate on this formula.  Once again, players are thrust into a beautiful, broad open world.  Once again, players will be fighting against a strong central villain this time around they lead a doomsday cult.The narrative of the game is helped along this time around by player explorationFar Cry 5 is somewhat more grounded that the third or fourth installments in the series.  The narrative, more player-driven, is focused around a rookie police officer who goes with a U.S. Marshall to arrest Joseph Seed.  The leader of the Eden’s Gate cult, Seed and his siblings are controlling the Hope, Montana region through force, through drugs, and through indoctrination of the locals.  Like any good Far Cry villain, Joseph Seed is eccentric and maniacal.  He preaches from the Book of Revelations that the end of the world is coming, and that the arrival of your character is the opening of the First of Seven Seals that will bring about the end of times.  After the arrest attempt is botched, you meet with a local resistance that puts you on the path to taking down the Seed clan.Broken into three distinct regions, Far Cry 5 is once again another massive game to explore.  Though there have been some key differences made to the way that the game is played.  Each region is headed by one of the Seeds.  Jacob, a soldier, controls the Northern Whitetail Region.  Faith, a Siren who deals in a deadly concoction known as Bliss, controls the East.  While John, controls the West.  Taking down each of these region leaders is the only way to reach Joseph and to free Hope from the cult’s clutches.  After completing the opening sequences that sets these events in motion and doing some tutorial type content at the start of the game, players can basically go anywhere and do anything in Far Cry 5.  They can choose to tackle any region they choose, and do it in any order they want.  Whether that be trying to complete all objectives in one region at once or bouncing back and forth.  While there are some differences to the gameplay in each region and the objectives that must be completed, they are largely the same.  How they differ is in the people that you’ll encounter along the way in Story and Side Missions.Missions types are exactly what you’ve come to expect from Far Cry gamesThere’s a number of things to do though.  You can tackle Cult Outpost challenges which are similar to previous Far Cry games.  You can rescue residents of Hope that are being held hostage by the cult.  There are cult transports that can be destroyed or looted.  There are cult VIPs that can be hunted down and killed.  There are the aforementioned story missions and side missions that can be completed in each region as well, which do naturally breathe life into the world.  For the most part, it all funnels back into a Resistance Meter.  The more activities that you complete, the more Resistance Points that you’ll earn and once you’ve maxed out the Resistance Points for each region you’ll be able to enter into a confrontation with the boss.  The Resistance Meter is tiered though, and as you progress through the meter the region becomes more and more chaotic as the cult leader tries to strike back at your efforts.You’re free to tackle challenges within a region in any way you see fit, and there are plenty of rewards for exploring and doing all of the quests you can get your hands on.  You can recruit specialist team members to your cause.  These include six human characters that have unique abilities and traits and three animal companions that each have unique abilities as well. While the game starts out with just one AI partner, you can bump that up to two through the game’s perk system.  If they die in combat, you’ll need to wait a little while for them to be able to respawn.  As far as open world games go, Far Cry 5 has a lot of variety.  You’ve got a lot of carry over with gameplay ideas from previous games like hunting for animals and outpost liberation, with gunplay and combat being largely familiar.  The way that the story and map expands through exploration and not just climbing towers is somewhat of a breath of fresh air.  There is plenty of character and variety to the cast that you’ll meet in Hope, Montana.  If there’s a character archetype that you can think of, you’ll probably meet them if you explore long enough.  That said, Ubisoft seems to be going for shock value in Far Cry 5.  From scenes of suicide, to missions that require you to beat animals with a baseball bat, there’s some stuff in here that is ONLY suitable for adults.There’s some really mature content that isn’t suitable for everyoneUbisoft has made some great strides on making the single player side of Far Cry 5 better.  The world that’s been built here is outstanding, and most of the character comes from the residents of Hope.  They’ve also pushed other aspects of the series further here as well.  The entire game is playable via online co-op.  Instead of the side-mission only structure of Far Cry 4, two-player online co-op allows a second player to join a game, much in the same way you would call on one of the AI Specialists characters to help you.  It’s worth noting that progression in co-op play is only for the host player, so missions that are accomplished by a group of players are only saved for the host of the game.While Multiplayer in Far Cry 4 was ambitious, and quite fun when you could find a full game of players to play with, Ubisoft has really bolstered their online offering in Far Cry 5.  Through a system called the Far Cry Arcade, players can not only play standard multiplayer type games and tackle new solo or cooperative missions, but they can again create maps and game variants of their own.  The Far Cry Arcade features map building tools that are incredibly complex which feature assets from many different Ubisoft games.  You could compare it to something like LittleBigPlanet, but for first person shooters.  In the pre-launch environment there was already a ton of variety here in terms of multiplayer maps and content that could be played by yourself in solo “hero” missions or cooperative missions that were built with the assets of Far Cry Arcade.  While it’s certainly not the first time Far Cry has flirted with map editor options, it’s definitely the most robust.  The editing tools are somewhat complex and this aspect of Far Cry Arcade is only for those that are willing to put in the time to learn the tools that are available to make something that is truly worth playing.  Tinkering around with the building tools, there are so many different options to play with that you could spend many, many hours in making the most simplistic of maps.  The downfall here is that I’m still not 100% sold on Far Cry multiplayer as something that has the gameplay chops to keep players coming back for more.  For those that do like it though, there’s plenty to keep you busy.Beautiful and bursting with contentFar Cry 5 is bursting at the seams with content.  You could easily sink 30 – 40 hours in the campaign and still not have seen everything before the credits roll.  While it’s not an exotic destination, the likes of which we saw in the last two Far Cry games —  Hope, Montana has it’s own sense of beauty.  The settings feel varied, from fog rolling through the tree lined hills, to waves rippling on crystal blue lakes, or dark nights where you can see every star in the sky — Far Cry 5 can be visually stunning at times.  Cutscenes are equally impressive on the presentation front.  The only thing that truly throws off the presentation aspect of Far Cry 5 is in the erratic behavior of NPC and enemy character models.  This aspect of the game still isn’t nailed down in my opinion.  From enemies just running around like chickens with their heads cut off to NPC characters not moving and getting stuck on terrain — there’s some “jank” to the game in this regard.  We didn’t experience anything game-breaking, but wouldn’t be surprised if others did.Ubisoft has done exactly what should be done in sequels.  They took what works in these games and built upon it while getting rid of the stuff that didn’t fit.  Instead of just throwing a ton of missions and content at the player, in Far Cry 5 you never really feel overwhelmed.  You’re naturally uncovering new missions, characters, and items.  Alongside this, they’ve topped their previous efforts in terms of world building and storytelling, all the while retaining the distinct feel of a Far Cry game.  While the last game felt like more of the same, with very few new ideas pushed to the forefront, Far Cry 5 feels a little more ambitious in the freedom it gives players.  In both the single player story mode and online modes, it’s clear Ubisoft wants you to play what you want, the way you want.We didn’t get it with the last two numbered entries in the series, but Far Cry 5 feels like the generation leap that fans have been waiting for.  Innovations in gameplay and a provocative story will keep you engaged for the entirety of this lengthy campaign.  The ability to do and see it all with a friend makes it even better, and for those that really dig in there’s a ton of online content to consume or create.  Far Cry 5 certainly feels like the biggest game in terms of content and it just might be the best Far Cry game to date.

Far Cry 5,Jeff Grubb,GamesBeat,https://venturebeat.com/2018/03/26/far-cry-5-review-its-about-filling-in-the-gaps/,"Connect with top gaming leaders in Los Angeles at GamesBeat Summit 2023 this May 22-23. Register here.If you’ve ever had a faux Christmas tree, then you know that they are exactly like video games. OK — maybe that needs an explanation.With a fake Christmas tree, you have to get into each branch and fluff out the individual limbs to fill in the gaps to make the “tree” look full, lush, and alive. The same is true for open-world games like Ubisoft’s Far Cry series. When a company like Ubisoft makes a Far Cry, it has to get into the various gameplay limbs to fluff them out to fill in the gaps. The goal, like with the tree, is to make games feel full and living.And when it comes to Far Cry 5, Ubisoft has made its most lifelike faux living world so far. The publisher accomplished this by creating a scattershot approach to gameplay experiences that are all fun and valid. At the same time, the company used a similar scattershot strategy for its storytelling, and that did not work as well.Far Cry 5 is an open-world shooter in which players take on a religious death cult in the mountain regions of Montana. You play the unnamed “deputy” hero of Hope County who must lead the people in a fight against the violent Project at Eden’s Gate (think the Branch Davidians of the Waco incident). Joseph Seed, who is known as “The Father” by the PEGies, is a prophetic figure who fits Ubisoft’s Far Cry-villain mold of an aggressive madman who wants you to suffer.GamesBeat Summit 2023Join the GamesBeat community in Los Angeles this May 22-23. You’ll hear from the brightest minds within the gaming industry to share their updates on the latest developments.Far Cry 5 is due out for PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4 on March 27.It’s the most well-realized Ubisoft open world yetUntil some startup simulates the entirety of life, games will always have gaps. What I mean by “gaps” is that, due to budget and time constraints, developers will focus their design efforts on a finite number of siloed gameplay experiences.Over here you have the combat, you can use vehicles, and maybe you have some minigames. Even within these distinct gameplay areas, you have gaps. Again, time and money may force some developers to remix repetitive elements to create multiple missions to fill out a game. But that grows old quick because you feel like you have explored an entire branch of a game after finishing only a couple of missions.Far Cry 5 excels at filling these gaps.The shooter has an astounding variety of activities that players can partake at any time. You can take on story missions; you can fly in stunt races; you can go fly-fishing; or you can go track down hidden stashes of weapons and other items. But the game is special because Ubisoft spent the time to fluff out these gameplay branches.The “Prepper Stash” is a great example of this. Far Cry 5 has hidden stores of weapons and other useful items hidden all over the map because every other person in Montana is a prepper just waiting for economic collapse. Ubisoft probably could have gotten away with just giving players a hint about the location and then having players go track those spots down. What it actually did, though, is create unique locations with bespoke puzzles that make each one of these treasure troves exciting to find and engaged with.I stumbled across one prepper stash while on another mission at the same farm. As I figured out the platforming and combat puzzle (bees don’t like fire) to get to the ammo and upgrade points, I found myself on top of a house with a zipline that would take me right to a semi-truck called The Widowmaker that I was supposed to steal back from the cultists.That was fun and interesting for both of those missions, but it was also distinct from the the prepper stash at the boat house or the one that requires you to shoot a sniper rifle through a window or the one that is a haunted house set up by what is obviously a serial killer/clown.That branching variety digs into combat as well. In one mission, you are supposed to take out three convoys of trucks. You can do this however you want, so for the first I set up remote explosions in the road. For the second convoy, I shot the driver and then shot the trucks until they exploded. For the final convoy, I mixed it up again and got into a plane and used its cluster bombs to take it out.This has filled in the gaps of Far Cry for me, and it means that I’m always having fun.Some delightful characterization and environmental storytellingFar Cry 5 has a tone problem, but it’s not ever present. Often, you’ll find yourself in moments or places that have a lot to say about the fictional world of Hope County and Far Cry 5 itself.One of these moments is the haunted house. In this prepper location, you power up the “house of terrors,” and go inside. This prepper set up their home to work just like a cheesy Halloween haunted house. You get jump scares and violent scenes with animatronic actors … except they aren’t puppets. They look exactly like the people you’ve been fighting against and saving the whole game.As I worked my way through that space, the reality of what I was seeing started to dawn on me: I’m in a serial killer’s house.Far Cry 5 has quite a few of these moments, and I adore them even if Ubisoft drowned them under overdramatic “crazy” bad guy stuff and comedic absurdity.It has wild tonal shifts that ruin both the comedy and the dramaOverall, Far Cry 5’s writing doesn’t work for me. You will go through some vicious whiplash in this narrative.In one mission, you are trying to kill bulls right as they are about to have sex so a chef can cook them up for a testical-eating festival. Throughout your ball quest, “Sexual Healing” by Marvin Gaye is playing on the soundtrack, and the game demands that you kill one of the bulls by chewing them up in a mulcher on the front of a tractor.In the next mission, you could find yourself listening to a manipulative villain talking about torturing people.What’s frustrating is that both of these tones are well executed on their own, but this is where Ubisoft’s attempts to fill in the gaps has failed. I can’t disassociate parts of this game from the other, and when I’m thinking about the “Testy Festy” as a man tattoos the sins of my character onto her body, I don’t know what to feel. Am I supposed to take this drama seriously? Because maybe a joke is coming at any moment … and then it doesn’t.And Ubisoft does have missions with a balance that works and acknowledges both extremes without pretending the other doesn’t exist.As you are coming off of an exhausting and intense boss fight against one of Joseph Seed’s family members, the game decides to give you a break. A pregnant woman you met earlier goes into labor, and she calls you to help her get to a medical professional. You show up at the same time as her husband, and he has you drive his truck. During this scene, you have the natural drama of a human giving birth, but Ubisoft uses this to punctuate how absurd the Far Cry world is.During your drive to the clinic, gun fights break out in the road around you, a plane crashes in front of your vehicle, and you have no choice but to take a ramp off of a bridge. While all of this is happening, the pregnant woman is screaming things like, “what is all of this?!” and “none of this makes any sense!”This is a great moment. It plays the frightening conceit of bringing a child into a place run by a cult against the over-the-top antics of the Far Cry games in an effort to act as comedic relief. But this is an exception. For the most part, Far Cry want to go from threatening and scary to silly and frivolous whenever it wants, and that hurts it.Far Cry 5 is mechanically sound and varied. You’ll find something that entertains you, and Ubisoft has nailed all of the underlying elements of character and world progression. At the same time, it squanders some decent writing because it can’t decide what kind of game it is.Score: 85/100Far Cry 5 is available March 27 for $60 on PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4.

At first glance, he looks like one of those Williamsburg hipsters I've come to regard with a resentful ennui. Sporting a man bun, beard and Aviator shades, I can totally see him ordering a blue algae latte while listening to the Pixies and condescendingly explaining the authenticity of the latest food craze. And yet there is a pervasive seductiveness in his voice that barely hides the menace lurking underneath.Over the past few years, Seed and his followers have become increasingly more threatening.

It's up to me to save my colleagues and innocent civilians from this end-times cult in Far Cry 5, the latest entry in the series.At its core, Far Cry 5 is at once different and familiar. A first-person sandbox shooter, you can play how you want from the start, running and gunning with grenade launchers and shotguns. Or you can take the stealth approach with throwing knives, silenced sniper rifles in the like. Or...you can just go fishing for awhile. In order to get to the main big baddie, Joseph Seed, you're going to have to go through his lieutenants and their legions of faithful Peggies. The lieutenants, Faith, John and Jacob Seed, have each carved out for themselves  a territory of Hope Valley. Similar to other Far Cry games, your job is to lure them out and destabilize their prospective territories by liberating Peggie-controlled outposts, destroying silos and any other cult property and rescuing any Hope County citizens you encounter along the way. To date, I've killed Peggies with a compound bow, a silenced 9mm pistol, an assault rifle and a stick of dynamite. Hell, I've sent my dog, Boomer, to dispatch hostiles, and then lit them up with a flamethrower. And when I wanted to take a more hands-on approach, I could sneak up and break someone's neck for a silent kill. It's nothing new if you've played any of the recent FC titles.Shooting is just as smooth as ever, but I'd recommend getting used to lining up your shots rather than trying to free aim. Since there's no auto lock, you run the risk of  missing the kill shot -- and trust me, you don't want to miss. Eden's Gate members are super- aggressive and have no problem flanking you from all sides. And that goes double for the stronger VIP cult members, who usually have on some type of body armor, or are hopped up on bliss. I can't tell you how many times I was fighting the good fight when I would get rushed by a few determined Peggies and sent to meet my digital maker. And things  get only more intense after you get marked. From then on, any Peggie that sees you will open fire, and at some point, planes and helicopters will be deployed to make your life a living hell.In Far Cry 4, you had the ability to call in a friend or two to help you out when the going got tough. in a separate co-op mode called Guns for Hire. The mechanic has been retooled in Far Cry 5, allowing you to recruit county residents you've liberated or helped in some way to fight with you. Each character has a pair of unique abilities that unlocks as the characters get more kills.In addition to your regular non-playable characters (NPC), you'll also run across Specialists, who have extraordinary talents, to lend a hand. Grace Armstrong, for instance is a talented sniper who can shoot targets from afar while you close in and pick off unsuspecting Peggies. Local pilot Nick Rye provides air support, putting down suppressing fire or dropping a few bombs on more troublesome problems.And while human companionship (even if it is NPC) is nice, there's nothing like the bond between a girl and her dog … or her bear or  cougar. FC5 has introduced the zany Fangs for Hire system, which allows you to recruit some of the local wildlife to your cause. Similar to Guns for Hire, your furry companion has different attacks. With both Guns and Fangs for Hire, you can have up to two additional members on your team. And while the human teammates are cool, Boomer the dog is adorable, and you have to opportunity to run around with a cougar named Peaches and a bear named Cheeseburger. Sounds like delicious mayhem to me.MORE: Here Are the Best PC Game ControllersBut what's the point of blowing up a few cultists if you've got to do it by yourself? FC5 brings back the co-op mode from FC4 and dubs it Friends for Hire. And instead of siloing it off in another part of the game, you and a friend can play in the main story almost as soon as the game starts. That means if you join a friend's game, you'll keep any Perks and weapons you earn for your own game. While I enjoy using the AI-powered characters, it's much easier to plan an attack with  human players, as they can improvise and adapt on the fly.The head of the Project at Eden's Gate (or Peggies, as Hope County residents derogatively call them) organization, or cult, if you want to get right down to it, Joseph Seed is a self-professed messiah. Using a perverted mix of Christianity and military, with a dash of doomsday sprinkled in for good measure, Joseph Seed has carved out his own slice of heaven in Hope County. Believing that he is chosen by God, Joseph and his lieutenants, whom he calls Heralds, seek to bring the population of Hope County into the fold by any means necessary. You can see hints of David Koresh and Jim Jones in Seed, and he and his Heralds use a number of indoctrination methods to break Hope County residents' spirits. Any interaction with Seed or any of his Heralds is tense -- you're waiting for something bad to happen -- and trust me it will happen. It's a dark tale of coercion via torture, psychological and chemical manipulation, that could have been terrifying if given a chance to live on its own.However, Ubisoft has crammed two games into this ambitious title, to the detriment of the main story. In one instance, I'm being held down and watching someone tattoo the word ""wrath"" onto my chest as they pontificate on why it was my fatal sin that must be cleansed. In another instance, I'm on a side mission where I teamed up with a diabetic black bear named Cheeseburger. (Bears can have diabetes? Who knew?) And in another, I had to harvest Rocky Mountain oysters from a bull in coitus, all while Marvin Gaye's ""Sexual Healing"" was playing in the background.MORE: The Best PC Games to Play Right NowAnd while these missions are definitely fun and elicited more than a few hearty guffaws, it just seems out of place in a game that then asks me to hunt down a guy affectionately known as ""The Cook"" who's burning people to death. The dual tonality is very much a part of the Far Cry ethos, but knowing that Ubisoft reached out to a cult specialist to give the Project at Eden's Gate some real teeth makes me wish the game would decide what it wants to be. It's like you've got your tense, psychological thriller in my fun, silly, shoot- 'em-up. Either game would be fun on its own, but I'm not sure that I need them in one place.I never want to leave this sandbox. Like most Ubisoft titles, Far Cry 5 is beautiful and massive. The fictional land of Hope County, Montana, encompasses is a land of rolling hills, majestic mountains, stately evergreens and bodies of water that can be placid ponds, babbling brooks or raging rivers. It's a love letter to the beauty of nature that most of us never get to see in person.Aside from random cougar and black bear attacks, and Peggies, always the damned Peggies, Hope County is a place I fully intend to sink many more hours into, and not just for the gratuitous violence. When I wasn't bringing the fight to Eden's Gate, I spent my time fly fishing to see if I could beat my record best for rainbow trout. It's a peaceful activity that lets me reminisce about fishing off the jetties for bluefish with my family. That is until, I heard the telltale roar of a cougar and I had to run, shoot or die.The man-made structures are pretty good, but like most video game buildings, there's far too many false doors for my taste. But overall, the buildings are varied enough to keep things interesting, particularly the prepper stashes that have puzzle elements built in.As downright pretty as FC5 is, there is a fly in the ointment in the form of the random glitches I encountered. I've fallen through the ground a few times, falling forever or until decided I had hit the ground and killed me. But my biggest annoyance involved interacting with objects in the environment. There were too many times when I had to adjust my positioning just to get the square Interact prompt to appear so I can open a door or flip a switch. It's a feature/bug that's cost me a few lives.Far Cry 5 is first game in the series to let you tweak gender and overall appearance. But before you start thinking you're going to make an exact digital copy of yourself, know that the customization options aren't as deep as a Dragon Age or a Fallout 4. You get a limited amount of skin tone and hair options with a relatively small wardrobe to dress your character. It's fine, but I'm hoping Ubisoft will build up this feature in future titles. MORE: Xbox One Games: Our Staff FavoritesIf you want more clothes, you'll have to buy them, and they're not cheap. An outfit consisting of a hat, shirt, pants (oddly enough, you don't buy shoes in this game) costs about $7,200. Although you can gather money fairly quickly in the game, just know you're going to spend a decent amount of time grinding if you want that snazzy new flannel.Honestly, I found that spending money on the various upgrades for my weapons, including scopes, suppressors and extended magazines was the best use of my hard-earned cash. But that's just me. When you're playing, you might decide that you need to slay Peggies in fashion.At its core, Far Cry 5 is just another fun entry in the series. You get to run around in a massive, lovingly created world, hunting, fishing and dispatching cult members along the way. Small tweaks that Ubisoft made to overall gameplay only serve to add even more polish to a formula that the company has all but perfected over the course of the series.However, FC5 is indeed a tale of two games, and I'm gnashing my teeth at the issues Ubisoft could have addressed in the story regarding the current political and social climate. They take definitive steps to make commentary on the cults and perverted uses of religion only to stop short of saying anything and further diluting the story with typical Far Cry antics. Lack of a deep message aside, I'm planning to spend many more hours in Hope County blowing up stuff and reeling in a bass or two, and that's more than OK.Credit: UbisoftSherri L.

Create Account If games are ever going to be taken seriously by the world at large as an art form capable of intelligent social commentary, major studios need to show some resolve when constructing their stories and characters.When Black Panther was unleashed on movie-going audiences in February it helped elevate the superhero film to something more than jaw dropping action sequences and clever wisecracks. It made a strong statement about racism, showing us how America’s systemic social flaws perpetuate hate and anger while suggesting those who can do something about it need to step off the sidelines and take action. And guess what? It’s now the highest grossing superhero movie of all time.Sign up to receive the daily top stories from the Financial Post, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.A welcome email is on its way. If you don't see it, please check your junk folder.The next issue of Financial Post Top Stories will soon be in your inbox. We encountered an issue signing you up. Please try again It was with hope of something similar that I entered into Ubisoft Montreal’s Far Cry 5, the latest entry in the French game publisher’s blockbuster open world action series that drops players into unpredictable playgrounds of chaos and mayhem created and shaped by charismatic and often ideological villains. This time out players are going up against something that ought to hit close to home for the series’ North American fans: An armed religious cult based in the wilds of Montana led by a preacher known as the Father.It’s hard to imagine a more topical subject. Proliferation of guns in America? Religion-motivated violence? The rise of right wing extremism? Check, check, and check. There’s all kinds of potential here for some legitimate analysis of and commentary on real world problems. But while Ubisoft’s writers boldly march up to the door, they’re too shy to start pounding on it, settling instead to whisper a few safe jokes before moving on.The game is loaded with bits of satire that broach all sorts of rural American topics. Flags and eagles are almost everywhere, cranky old timers rant about aggressive liberals ruining their way of life (with a couple of witty nods to Canadian socialism), and isolated doomsday preppers keep well stocked concrete bunkers. There are plenty of places where you can see how the writers drew inspiration from real life cults and local reactions to them, particularly the Oregonian Rajneesh movement back in the 1980s, which took over an entire town and even created its own armed police force.Yet whenever Far Cry 5 seems to come close to taking a stand or trying to say something, it backs down.Take, for example, a side mission involving a local politician who’s worried that the expanding number of cultists will vote as a block and make it impossible for him to win an upcoming election. He briefly brings up the topic of gerrymandering – which gave me hope that I was about to embark on a sly mission to somehow alter the world map – but then quickly dismisses it and suggests that it would be easier to decrease the cultist population simply by killing off as many of them as we can.It’s this falling back on video game convention (don’t let the story get in the way of the player killing things!) that keeps Far Cry 5 from living up to its full potential.That said, it’s not hard to understand why Ubisoft chose to keep the series’ status quo. The franchise has some very compelling and oft-copied institutions of play that remain compelling from one game to the next, and they provide all the reason most returning players will need to invest in Far Cry 5.The series’ signature outpost raids, for example, are still a major part of the game. You’ll scope them from afar, tag all the guards, then try to work out a way to take them down quietly – melee, sniping, or perhaps releasing a caged wolf – without raising any alarms so as to avoid reinforcements. And, thanks to a new ally “roster” system that lets us have up to two computer controlled buddies with specific combat proficiencies at our side, our options are now more varied than ever. In fact, once I unlocked a pair of pilot specialists – one flying a plane, another a helicopter – it almost made outposts too easy.And you’ll still need to be wary of wild animals, including bison, grizzlies, and cougars. We no longer need to collect their skins to make ammunition pouches, as we have in the past, but their hides are worth something to shop owners and their meat can be used as bait to lure predators to attack enemies. Some of the most challenging missions involve hunting down rogue game driven into raging frenzies by a cultist wonder drug called Bliss.It’s not all the same, though. The designers have pulled a couple of things from the formula, and mostly for the better.Frustrating first-person tower climbing – one of my biggest peeves in other Far Cry instalments – is, happily, more or less absent from this iteration. Of course, you still need to reveal important spots on the map, but this is now handled by talking to random folks who sum up key locations and create missions in just a couple of quick sentences. It’s an organic means of learning more about the world.On the subject of the game’s world, Ubisoft’s depiction of rural Montana will, for some, be reason enough to give Far Cry 5 a spin. The region in which the game takes place – Hope County – is fictional, yet still captures the natural majesty of the state’s sprawling farms, pine-covered low mountains, and beautiful crystal clear lakes. If the roads and forests weren’t absolutely crawling with homicidal cultists who attack the player on sight, I could have spent hours just wandering around enjoying the scenery.Still, picturesque setting and unsurprisingly polished game mechanics aside, I came away wishing for something a bit more nourishing.I was fairly entertained on the sort of uncomplicated, straightforward level that involves cracking a crooked smile at the notion of pawing through piles of doggy doo-doo to find an inadvertently swallowed house key and basking in the satisfaction of watching a friendly grizzly bear tear through a clutch of enemies, saving me the trouble.But if you’re looking for an insight or two into the sociopolitical troubles currently haunting the country in which Far Cry 5 is set, best not to get your hopes up.

Far Cry 5,Alex Wiltshire,"Rock, Paper, Shotgun",https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/03/29/far-cry-5-review/,"Freedom, at a priceAh, a new Far Cry has appeared! Having torn up the Himalayas, Polynesia, Central Africa and The Past, in Far Cry 5 Ubisoft’s lidlessly searing eye for endless open-world violence has turned to the USA. Specifically, we're in Montana, where Ubisoft have conjured a new set of colourfully monologuing nemeses who toy with you as they enact their Bad Plans while you try to ignore them so you can get on with the important business of hanging out with animal pals. Which particular brand of environment and Kurtz-like do we get this time? Let’s find out. Since Far Cry’s baddies are so often sculpted by their settings, let's start with Montana, which is the series’ most authentic location yet. While Hope County’s square miles of rolling pasture, small towns, sun-shafted forests, trailer parks, wide rivers and crystal creeks, summer camps and soaring mountains are fictional, they’re very specific constructs. It's a place of archetypes, even stereotypes, but they're closely observed and realised. It’s earthy and proud, home to sport hunters and survivalists, Republicans and farmers, and just like the real Montana, it’s beautiful.  
 
Now, though, it’s been taken over by a preacher called Joseph Seed, who is forcefully converting its people to his cause, a cult called Eden’s Gate. He and his three sub-bosses look like alt-right hipsters, all man buns, well-groomed beards, tattoos and artfully torn gauzy dresses, but their cultist hordes wear long leather coats and bandoliers, their beards are massive and unkempt, and they string up bodies upside down on signboards so you know they mean business. And like Far Cry 3’s Vaas, Seed delivers his long prophetic speeches right into the camera with a lot of eye contact, so you know he means business too. But he’s a lot more serious than Vaas. Played by Nic Healey with quiet messianic verve, he’s sinister and powerful, and no fun at all. 
 
And yet the wider game knows, just as 4 did, that Far Cry at its best is a playground for fun. It took about 45 minutes from the start before I was flying a helicopter. The parachute costs one Perk point, which took far less time. The wingsuit is four Perk points, which wouldn’t have taken much longer if it was my priority. Far Cry 5 is very much a ‘play it your way’ game, and it means business. The Perk system is one of many bits of Far Cry cruft that this new game has tidied up and reorganised. Rather than through earning XP, you get Perk points by completing challenges, such as skinning bears, flamethrowing perps, catching a nice fish, or finding outdoor recreation magazines that are scattered around the world, and since most Perks aren’t arranged on skill trees, you’re free to focus your abilities on your playstyle. What’s more, many Perks pull through to Arcade mode, which gives you the chance to make maps and gametypes of your own with assets pulled from across the Ubiverse. It’s a staple of the series, but in giving access via arcade machines scattered across the world, it has new focus here, and its promise will be proven over the coming weeks. 
 
The famous big change to the core game, though, is that you don’t have to climb towers to open up the map, something it pointedly illustrates by making you climb an extra high tower and then having Dutch, your survivalist bunker-dwelling radio chum radio, “I know what you’re thinking, and no, I’m not asking you to climb radio towers all over the county.” Good one, Far Cry 5. Instead, you fill in the map by simply going places, or by talking to NPCs with a map symbol above their head to add specific points of interest to it. The map, by the way, is wonderful, presented in full 3D so not only can you pan, zoom and rotate around it, but it’s also very easy to navigate because it looks like the world itself, and it doesn’t present the usual Ubisoft riot of icons to clear, instead delegating #content to a quest list on another screen.Overall, Far Cry 5’s progression systems are dialled down, quieter; even its UI is designed to fade out so it doesn’t clutter your view. While there’s a wide array of wildlife to shoot, you don’t have to hunt it in order to craft your gear, as you did in previous games. You simply sell skins and fish you catch, and invest your money in vehicles and guns and their upgrades. It’s all very open; the one element that only gradually unlocks as you complete the campaign is higher tiers of guns and vehicles, but even then, you’re well outfitted simply by upgrading the early guns and buying the relevant perks. Far Cry 5 is very keen not to get in the way. 
 
Until, that is, you try to get from one place to another. Which, uh, is a good deal of the game. I grumbled in my Review in Progress about the way you’re constantly bombarded with ’Peggies’, the name your Resistance friends have given Eden’s Gate cultists. Driving along any road is an exercise in being shot at and distracted by enemy vehicles and patrols every few seconds. Try to walk anywhere before you’ve upgraded your health and you’ll often die several times on the journey. I found things settled as I got more powerful and understood what it was worth getting out of the car to deal with, but I also found myself turning to the fast travel option more frequently than I’d like. Then again, when I sparked up my old Far Cry 4 save I found Kyrat surprisingly busy, and it had those bloody eagles, too. And we all remember the pain of Far Cry 2’s respawning outposts. Far Cry always did put a lot of bodies in front of anyone just trying to get around, but here the volume seems pitched a little too high. Dealing with all of those interruptions isn't quite as grim as it might be thanks to combat design that I reckon is the best in the series. Over the 15 hours it took me to complete the campaign, most of the outposts and other bits and pieces, I killed 1529 Peggies, and the only dull fights were the scrappy little emergent ones which didn’t last long enough for me to get stuck into. The shooting feels responsive and precise in a way that the series hasn’t achieved before, the environments constantly providing fun options and opportunities. In particular, the outposts encompass a fine range of industrial halls, precipitous towers, cluttered yards and domestic houses, their twists and turns complementing the AI’s focus on dynamic movement. Its stealth is finely tuned, too, so that your cover is quick to blow but, in turn, it’s usually easy enough to reposition and leave enemies confused. While death comes easily, I feel encounters play out on my terms. 
 
Further supporting Far Cry 5’s sense of freedom is its Gun for Hire system, which lets you choose an AI partner to play alongside. There are randoms and you can also unlock a roster of nine preset characters which each focus on a different play style. There’s Cheeseburger the bear, which aggros enemies with abandon, Jess Black the stealthy archer, the RPG-toting Hurk (yes, the series stalwart), Boomer the enemy-sighting dog, and Nick Rye, who pilots a seaplane. You can command them to move to locations and to attack targets (Nick Rye will strafe and lay down exasperatingly inaccurate bombs after agonising delays - he’s my favourite), and they’ll inform your approach to any situation, bringing in extra ordnance and tactical choices. They’re useful and good to have around, particularly as they’ll revive you if they can get to you before you bleed out, but fair warning: they’ll also block doorways, and there was that time a helicopter wouldn’t spawn from the shop because Grace Armstrong, the sniper, was standing on the helipad. 
 
The story missions largely do a good job of mixing up self-initiated encounters with assaults on heavily defended buildings, defending positions against waves of attackers, or destroying caches of Bliss, a hallucinogenic drug being manufactured by the cult to control the people. Few are anything you haven’t done before in a Far Cry, but they’re well-staged and good at imposing frantic situations where you're not entirely in control. Mixed with other pursuits, such as locating prepper stashes - an excellent series of well-rewarded environmental puzzles - they’re good changes of pace.The reason why you’re doing all of this is to earn Resistance Points in each of the map’s three regions to fill their individual Resistance gauges. Once they're full, you face the boss of that region. In the north there’s the Nazi-ish strong-shall-survive Jacob, Faith the lying Bliss-peddler in the east, and in the west John, who likes carving GLUTTONY on people’s chests before tearing their skin off. Resistance is essentially a notoriety system which leads Eden’s Gate into throwing more and more at you, so that at the upper end a plane hunts you, a constant airborne threat which adds an extra level of effort to travel the world. What’s more, crossing Resistance thresholds will pull you into story missions with the region’s boss, part of an arc that plays out across the region as you get to know the key friendly NPCs and become embroiled in their own stories.  
 
The way the game initiates these missions is strange, framed as the boss sending a crack squad to hunt you down, and that means you might be in the middle of a conversation with an NPC and suddenly find your vision blurring as you fall into a very contrived scenario that you’ll need to complete to return to your game. The first time it happened to me I’d just crashed my helicopter and found myself being brought before John with no idea how I’d triggered the encounter. These sequences service the story and its antagonists’ gravitas, I suppose, but in a game otherwise so keen to get out of your way they feel jarring.And that’s especially true because the story that these encounters kept dragging me to failed to convince me. Ubisoft has made many specific and portentous choices for Far Cry 5’s setting and setup, from the socio-political landscape of contemporary Montana to the dynamics of personality-driven cults, and it fails to resolve any of them. Rather than examine how normal people might be enveloped into violent and sadistic cults, Eden’s Gate is instead simply a mechanism which provides an anonymous evil to shoot at and also zombies, the Bliss-addled Angels. Its leaders emptily question your attempts to stop them, asking in their frequent crazy monologues, “But what if we’re right???” And then you remember they have headless bodies strung outside their bunker. Nope, they’re pretty straightforward evil. 
 
The non-cult people of Hope County, meanwhile, are more fleshed out, but as well performed as they are, they’re not subtle. They’re crusty farmers, corrupt Republicans, survivalist veterans and brassy working class. On one hand, Montana is drawn as a homeland of the right wing with the air of the ridiculous about it, and on the other, their individualist beliefs, particularly the gun rights so many of them vocally support, have enabled them to resist Eden’s Gate. You take missions from an NPC who is torturing a cultist. Conversations acknowledge this might not be ideal, but the game leaves the issue hanging. Ubisoft weren't predicting the rise of Trump when they started developing Far Cry 5, or the changing social and political landscape in America, but the game responds directly to current events with the odd one-liner, such as in mission titles like ‘Make Hope Great Again’ (in which you have to kill some cultists because they won’t vote for a Republican NPC gunning for senate). Far Cry 5 deals with its relationship with reality awkwardly, its adjacency to current affairs in the US continually jutting into what could, and probably should, be the more uncomplicated fun the rest of the game works so hard to enable. The fundamental problem is that the game doesn’t obey the dramatic principle of Chekov’s gun. Whatever your personal stance on these issues, it’s distracting for the game to raise them and then cast them aside without due care.  
 
Far Cry 5 is frustratingly uneven as a whole. From minute to minute its combat systems are the best in the series, and its vehicles handle better than those in previous games as well. Its landscapes are a delight, their details rich and worth exploring, and you get to develop your playstyle and objectives on your own terms. Until something gets in the way. It wants you to enjoy all of the freedom it offers until, through its systems, characters or story, an interruption arrives. It's the land of the free, but that freedom only goes so far.Far Cry 5 is out now and is available on Steam and UPlay for £49.99/€59.99/$59.99.You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

Far Cry 5,Ron Burke,GamingTrend,http://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/the-rise-of-terror-in-hope-county-far-cry-5-review/,"Before we talk about Far Cry 5, I need to address a problem that Ubisoft had been battling for a while — Intellectual Property stagnation. Assassin’s Creed had fallen into a rut, as had Rainbow Six, and some might argue Splinter Cell and even Far Cry. I believe they recognized that, and we’ve seen proof of it. Rainbow Six is stronger than it ever has been, thanks to the directional shift Siege brought to the table. Assassin’s Creed Origins builds on the familiar formula, but shakes it up with a purposeful shakeup of gameplay mechanics. Now Far Cry is getting the same treatment. With a radically familiar setting, a new approach to exploration, an overhaul of character progression, and a fresh take on Far Cry 2’s buddy system, could Far Cry 5 be the bold rebirth this series needs?Far Cry games prior to this have always taken place in parts of the world where you can believe that lawlessness could exist without interference from the local or military authorities. Taking place in Montana, Far Cry 5 centers once again around the rise of a despotic psychopath, Joseph Seed — a man they call The Father. Jacob believes that he was chosen by God to cleanse the wickedness of man, with or without their consent. Supported by his two brothers, John and Jacob, and their “sister” Faith (she just “showed up” one day, so familial connection is unclear), Joseph has built up a cult called the Project at Eden’s Gate that follow him unquestioningly, shutting down all roads, communication, and chance for escape. With the fictional (but very plausible, given my real-life time stationed in Montana) community of Hope County fully locked down, your task is to break the grip of this militaristic religious cult, putting an end to the Seed family once and for all.Oh, and you’ll do it with the help of a cougar named Peaches, a dog named Boomer, a bear named Cheeseburger, and a handful of colorful human characters too.Before you get started in the game, you should probably watch the Far Cry 5 tie-in video exclusively on Amazon Prime called “Far Cry 5: Inside Eden’s Gate” as the game picks up precisely at the end of that excellent talent showcase. Summarizing, a group of Vloggers haphazardly try to infiltrate the Project at Eden’s Gate to uncover what’s going on, but end up the target of some serious violence instead. With their hidden cameras still rolling, they are captured, tortured, and force-converted by the Seeds. That video, safely uploaded to the cloud, serves as the motivation for the U.S. Marshals to seek to arrest Joseph Seed. The player is cast as a Jr. Deputy on his or her (this is the first time you can choose the sex of the protagonist) first day on the job, as you, Deputy Pratz, Deputy Hudson, and Marshall Burke land a helicopter in the church compound where The Father is currently holding sermon over his flock. Clapping the handcuffs on his wrists, he declares that “God will not let you take me”. Shortly afterwards, this prophecy rings true, and you find yourself on your own, the previously aforementioned cast of characters captured, split up, and held by the members of the Seed family.The gameplay loop in previous Far Cry games revolved around climbing towers, revealing a host of icons, and then chasing down a grip of fetch quests with the occasional story bit wedged in. I’m not denigrating the previous games, far from it, actually, but they had fallen into a bit of a formulaic pattern. The team at Ubisoft Montreal shook things up, and other than the initial radio tower, you won’t be climbing them any longer. Instead, once you complete the tutorial island, you are free to explore as you see fit. There is a fog of war that spreads across the game’s three regions, each split between Faith, Jacob, and John Seed, respectively, and uncovering missions is now a function of conversation and exploration. Talking to people and stumbling on situations opens the world to you, and that approach endears you to the world in a far more holistic way. I care about the people of Hope County.Beyond the story setup changes, there are a great many system overhauls in Far Cry 5, skill and character advancement being chief among them. Rather than building your arsenal through collecting pelts and crafting materials, you’ll advance your character’s skills through picking up perks.By changing the skill system, it refocuses the game by encouraging the player to try new things. Earning perks is tied to challenges like taking out enemies with each type of weapon, catching each type of fish, or even gliding over a certain distance with the wingsuit. These push the player to explore, asking them to get out of the natural comfort zone that might let them settle for a pair of weapons and just using a helicopter for transport. Sure, you can still hunt, but you don’t have to chase down dozens of majestic creatures to craft a leather pouch that somehow gives you health anymore.Far Cry 2 introduced a buddy system, but Far Cry 5 has given it a drastic overhaul with their Guns/Fangs For Hire system. There are a total of nine characters you can recruit, three in each region, and each have two skills apiece that can change up your playstyle. As an example, Peaches the cougar can silently stalk and take down foes, but Boomer can mark all targets in the area, take down targets, and retrieve guns from fallen foes because he’s a good boy. Cheeseburger the bear is a bear, so he does bear things like mauling his target and terrifying the enemy. Jess uses a bow with incendiary rounds, so, while she is silent, she also spreads chaos in a big way as the foliage around her targets burst into flames. Hurk is hillbilly strong, carries a rocket launcher, and will not shut up about the Monkey King. Without getting into all nine, there’s one more worth noting, and that’s Nick Rye. Nick flies a plane and can strafe and bomb targets from above. If you are the type of person who likes to use a .50 cal sniper rifle from a nearby mountain and need someone to sow chaos to scatter targets, Nick is your man. Through the use of the perk system, you can have up to two For Hire friends in the field.Rescuing people in the field allows you to add three generic folks to your crew as well. While they don’t have special powers, they provide great distraction while you set up your overall strategy. In practice, once I had a few For Hire folks to choose from, I stopped putting these people in harm’s way. They don’t last long, and it seemed the humane thing to do.Much and more has been said about microtransactions in the last few months, so I wanted to address them directly here. Before launch, the microtransaction system wasn’t enabled, so I got a great look at the game as it exists without them. Frankly, I found them to be not only optional, but completely unnecessary. The game never felt like it was built to pad out the gameplay, or that you needed it to battle the AI. You’ll buy most things with cash you get from accomplishing objectives, hunting, or looting from foes. There are some items that are labeled as “prestige” that require a bit more cash to purchase, or you can pick them up for “silver bars”. Like real preppers, the folks of Hope County believe in truly “hard currency”. These are often cosmetic, or have little difference between the items you can loot off enemies, or collect anywhere in the world. You can’t pick up perk skill points with them, or otherwise influence advancement in the game, so I found that I simply ignored them. In the end, if you have a helicopter that has guns and missile launchers, why should you pay real money for the one with flames on it? I mean, hey — it’s your money, and I’m not your dad, you do you, but ultimately I don’t even see a time saving angle here.The audio in Far Cry 5 is a tour de force. Tony Gronick from Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon and Far Cry 4 returns to the series with a carefully crafted soundtrack of over six hours of music that feels like it could have been lifted directly from a Montana radio station Gronick’s soundtrack is equal parts eerie and eventually infuriating, but in the right way. From the opening ominous, yet beautiful rendition of Amazing Grace, to the bespoke hymns and inspirational songs that pop up on the radio of cultists when you seize their vehicles, the music eventually serves as a reminder of just how powerful charisma-driven brainwashing (with a dash of chemical help) can be.There is one area where a little more recording time might have helped — your For Hire friends. No matter who you choose, unless it has fangs and claws, they will inevitably loop into voice repetition land pretty quickly. Worse still, guys like Nick will jump in with a short snippet about how he was taught to shoot at an early age right in the the middle of dialogue you are trying to hear. I’m partially deaf so I use subtitles anyway, but Jess, Hurk, Sharky, Grace, Adelaide, and Nick need to shut up a bit.While it is entirely possible (and quite fun!) to complete Far Cry 5 as an entirely solo experience, bolstered by the Guns/Fangs for Hire system, the game is an absolute blast with real-life friends. If enabled by you as the host, your friends can drop in at any time, joining your game in progress. Every single mission, side or main, can be played together. Better still, that friend takes the place of one of your possible two Guns/Fangs for Hire positions, leaving the last slot to bring in someone like Cheeseburger. While friends like Boomer can resuscitate you when you are down, there’s nothing quite like having a pal to coordinate a blitz.When another player joins your game, your campaign as the host becomes the center. You can earn perks, complete challenges, collect weapons, and more, and those will stick when you pop back to your own game. On the other hand, your quests, activities, unlocks, and reputation are not — those only move forward when you are the host.There are a host of entirely cosmetic outfits your character can wear, ranging from flannel to outfits unlocked from owning other Ubisoft games, including a full loincloth getup from Far Cry Primal. These really only show up during co-op, so it’s a good time to let your freak flag fly with your friends.My only big axe to grind with Far Cry 5, beyond the voice repetition, is the occasional pathing bug where your Guns/Friend for Hire buddies leave you to die as you bleed out because they can’t figure out how to get to you, and the yawn-inducing 30 second loading sequence on PlayStation 4 when failing any objective. PlayStation 4 Pro drops that by five seconds, but it’s still a long time to wait to get back to the fun.Drew Holmes (you might recall his work on Bioshock Infinite) wrote the storyline for Far Cry 5, and it is brilliant. Greg Bryk turns in a haunting performance as The Father, and Seamus Dever is equally as gritty as John Seed. In point of fact, all of the cast turns in compelling performances, and on only a few occasions did my wife and I get a laugh as somebody’s Montana accent slipped into more Montreal territory.Because the world can be tackled in any order, the storyline would seemingly be disconnected and isolated into three compartments. Surprisingly, it is not. Sure, it’s not as cohesive and well-stitched as a linear game, but characters know about what’s happening in their region, and they acknowledge events that happen. Taking a note from Ghost Recon: Wildlands, the three Seed family members require that you raise the resistance levels in an area to get your hands on these bosses. Rescuing civilians, shutting down outposts, uncovering Prepper bunkers, and helping the locals with their problems moves the needle towards a showdown with the Seed member you’ve selected to take down. The storyline does tend to settle into a pattern that I won’t reveal here, but when a specific event happens several times for each one of the three regions, it feels like a small misstep amidst a far stronger surrounding narrative.Throughout the game there are arcade cabinets that give you access to the map editor system. Exiting from the campaign, you’ll gain access to an extensive engine that will allow you to build just about anything you can imagine using in-game assets from Far Cry 5, as well as other Ubisoft properties like Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag, Assassin’s Creed Unity, and Watch Dogs. It pushes squarely into the “why not?” territory, letting the player build completely ridiculous content, and that’s simply awesome. I’ve played something that closely resembled Counter-Strike, but I’ve also had a chance to experience something that can only be described as horror as well. It’s impossible to predict what sort of craziness the public will build when given access to unbridled creativity and time, but the click-and-place simplicity of the system should give them everything they need to make whatever they could imagine.Even without this mode, there’s plenty of content to explore in Far Cry 5 — easily approaching 30 hours of it, and none of it ever felt padded. That’s a feat few other open-world games pull off.With new gameplay mechanics, overhauled progression systems, a strong narrative, and the Guns/Friends for Hire system, Far Cry 5 is the overhaul that the series desperately needed. It is easily the best of the series, and represents a positive step in a new direction.

Far Cry 5,Tom Hoggins,Telegraph,http://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/reviews/far-cry-5-review/,"Far Cry 5 may not be the biting allegory on the rise of the ‘alt-right’ in Trump’s United States that some envisaged, but it still cuts close to the bone of the culture of God-fearing, gun-toting rural America. And deliberate or not, makes for a fascinating backdrop to a compelling, if conflicted, action romp.Indeed, developer Ubisoft’s protestations that the latest in its excellent open-world series was not intended to be political seems untrue within minutes. You play as a local deputy in the fictional region of Hope County, Montana, flown in to apprehend ‘Father’ Jacob Seed, charismatic leader of The Project at Eden’s Gate. This ever-growing, heavily-armed religious cult has been terrorising and overthrowing Hope through drugs and dogma, brainwashing those susceptible to their cause, killing those that are not and cutting off contact with the rest of the country.As you step into his church, Seed is preaching to his flock, warning of those that will defy them and “take away their guns”. At a time when the gun debate rages in America and fringe churches are blessing assault rifles, Far Cry 5’s setup and setting make for an uncomfortably contemporary parable. The scenario and the Seed family are undermined by hammy, cartoonish excess, but the gun-worshipping undercurrent has some bite.And that’s just the bad guys. When good old Merle, a member of the burgeoning resistance looking to liberate the County, offers up a garish pick-up truck called ‘Death Wish’ that has a 60 caliber machine gun on the back, it’s no surprise that Hope has turned into a warzone.That’s the backdrop. And it is a shame that tends to be all it is. Naturally the arrest doesn’t go so well and Far Cry 5 plays the rest of the scenario with a straight bat. Save for some low-hanging Trump digs, the games avoids delving into the ‘Peggies’ ideology too deeply. Instead it is nudged to the peripheries to let you get on with Far Cry’s trademark hijinks.While this does cause some jarring tonal disconnect, and smacks of wasted potential, it is impossible to deny the allure of Far Cry 5’s action. Your task is to liberate three different regions of Hope County, each presided over by a member of the Seed family. The entirety of the huge map is open from the beginning, letting you take on Jacob’s ‘heralds’ in any order. Once you enter a region, you must stir up the resistance by completing missions, assaulting outposts, freeing hostages and generally making a nuisance of yourself. Each action earns ‘resistance points’, until you rattle the local herald enough to force a showdown.Being an open-world Ubisoft game, there is an ungodly amount of stuff to do. But despite its breadth, Far Cry 5 manages to avoid the icon splurge that threatens to overwhelm. By partitioning the regions, doling out story missions at a measured rate and making most of what you do count towards your goal, there is an impressive amount of focus in its freedom.And mechanically this is a strong open-world shooter with a fine line in improv. The gorgeous roads, mountains and forests of Hope crackle with menace every time you set out, with cultists roaming the area ready to start a firefight on first glance. This particular brand of combat is punchy and panicky, diving out of cars to take cover (or using them as battering rams), lobbing sticks of dynamite underneath trucks to send them pinwheeling in a blooming explosion. It’s bracing stuff which communicates a sense of a region at war with both sides dedicated to their cause. Think latter-day Walking Dead without the zombies.When you do get to plan ahead, for more traditional missions or attacks on outposts, there is plenty in your arsenal to vary your approach. Scouring the perimeter popping heads with a sniper rifle, sneaking through outpost buildings with a silenced pistol or baseball bat, crashing through the front gate in an armoured truck or dropping bombs from above in the newly added planes.You also have your pick of specialist companions, a feature of Far Cry that has steadily built up to this fully featured roster of soldiers, pilots and, er, animals (carried over from the excellent spin-off Far Cry Primal, though you can't ride them this time). Each region has three different ‘guns (or fangs) for hire’, which you must find and aid before they join your cause. You can then assign up to two to your squad and each offer notably different skills. Grace the sniper, Nick the pilot providing air support, the much-trailed dog Boomer sniffing out and tagging enemies. There is even a giant attack bear named Cheeseburger.While the companions behaviour is far from perfect (they have an odd habit of setting themselves on fire), they are devilishly effective at times and the variety offers definable tactics. Just make sure you don’t have the RPG-toting Hurk when you are planning to go stealth… the specialists know what they’re good at.Even when you go in with a plan, your best intentions can be laid to waste. One particular mission to pinch a truck from a gas station should have been a milk run. I was picking off the light platoon of cultists before a rampaging wild bear came storming out from the forest opposite. Ol’ grizzly crushed one bad guy and sent the others scattering, one cultist jumping into the truck and making a dash for it.Meanwhile the panic had sent an ignited barrel skittering into the brush, fire spreading as I commandeered a nearby ATV and zipped through the licking flames. The resulting chase winded through the forest as I took potshots with my pistol at the fleeing drivers window, before he eventually slammed the truck into oncoming traffic. The vehicle went careening off the verge, crashing into a shallow stream below, meaning I could wander down and claim my prize.This is Far Cry at its best. It isn’t the tightest shooter or the most inventive in its mission design, but when its unscripted chaos takes over, few games can match it. Far Cry 5 is particularly good at facilitating this. And while much of the game cuts a familiar figure for series veterans, it is a rare session indeed that doesn’t provide some unexpected fireworks.It is an enormously enjoyable romp, even if its barmy nihilism jars against the more sombre but ultimately shallow attempts in narrative. Conflicted, yes, but in the end, chaos wins out."
Far Cry 5,Jez Corden,Windows Central,http://www.windowscentral.com/far-cry-5-review,"No offers foundWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.Far Cry as a series has never really taken itself too seriously. It's a sandbox adventure series known for truly psychotic villains, Hollywood-style over-the-top action, with guerrilla-style stealth combat. Far Cry 5 fully embraces what the series does best with a confidence lacking in previous titles.Simply put, this is one of the best open world games you can possibly play on Xbox One today. Here is our Far Cry 5 review.Let's not beat around the bush, Far Cry 5 is an utterly stunning title on Xbox One X, joining other recent Ubisoft efforts like Assassin's Creed Origins as one of the best looking games for the console. The game is enhanced with UHD scaling resolutions on the X, at 30 FPS with HDR support. Sadly, there are no graphics tweaks, such as a 60 FPS performance mode, but perhaps they could arrive in a later update.In Far Cry 5, Ubisoft has proven itself to be a master of the craft once again.Set in a fictional county in the U.S. state of Montana, Far Cry 5 takes place across a huge expanse of land, with several distinct areas that depict environments in the American north west. Huge grain farms and rolling hills, gigantic mountains that you can travel to, and deep, verdant forests that you could get lost in, where it not for the game's compass and map systems.Far Cry 5 packs tons of details into its open world, cutting out the sense of copy and paste that some other titles fall prey to. I was wandering through a serene forest, when I happened upon some friendly NPCs dancing, while one played a rendition of traditional American folk song ""Where did you sleep last night?"" on guitar, bathed in the glow of a HDR campfire. They weren't for a quest, they were just there to add flavour and believability to Far Cry 5's rural world.Speaking of music, Far Cry 5 warps folk and country tones with all sorts of genres for its soundtrack. The fusion shouldn't work but it somehow does, evoking tension during combat scenes, and dread as you stalk through one of the cult's corpse-filled bunkers. The musicians on Far Cry 5 are a huge cornerstone for this game's unique character.Ubisoft are known for creating gorgeous vistas and expansive open worlds, and in Far Cry 5, the company has proven itself to be a master of the craft once again.Far Cry could be described as a series of ""what if?"" stories, often exploring real-world locations and regional politics. Far Cry 5 is no different.Drawing on inspiration from real-world cults like ISIS and The People's Temple, Far Cry 5's ""Eden's Gate"" warps established religious doctrine to self-fulfil an apocalyptic vision. Joseph Seed, a preacher otherwise known as ""The Father"" has amassed a huge following owing to a combination of his uncanny charisma, and control of a narcotic known as ""Bliss.""I'm confident Seed and his ""family"" will be remembered as some of the series' all-time great villains.The game starts when Far Cry 5's silent and customizable protagonist, a rookie Sheriff deputy, joins a Federal agent to enact an arrest warrant for Joseph Seed, on charges of kidnapping.Far Cry 5 has one of the best introductions in the series, if not the best. Entering Eden's Gate's compound is a tense affair, as violent fanatics encircle the rookie deputy and his colleagues like a pack of wolves. As you might expect, things go south, fast, as the rookie deputy and their team unwittingly fulfils Joseph Seed's apocalyptic ""prophecy."" It becomes readily apparent that Eden's Gate has control of the entire valley, including the local police and communications services. With all communications and road access cut off, it's on you to begin dismantling the cult and its sizable militia, which has taken root in Hope County like a fanatical cancer.Greg Bryk's portrayal of Joseph Seed is utterly bone-chilling, and I'm confident Seed and his ""family"" will be remembered as some of the series' all-time great villains. Not just because of the game's confident writing, but also some systemic changes Ubisoft has made.Similarly to other Ubisoft-style open world games, the player must work their way through the game's open-world regions, performing missions that unlock story quests, unlocking Seed's lieutenants. Once they have been dealt with, you can go after the big evil himself. The difference is, Far Cry 5 has far fewer supporting antagonists than usual, allowing for a much greater degree of character development. This makes impactful scenes far more evocative and memorable, as you'll have a greater understanding of your enemies motivations and evil deeds.The main plot is full of depravity, exploring the full spectrum of evil humanity is capable of, but some of the game's side quests are a little sillier and light-hearted exploring stereotypes of countryside life. I did one quest revolving around crop-circles, cattle mutilation and ""aliens,"" and then went straight into a Seed family torture chamber right afterwards. As a result, the tone of the game can come across as erratic depending on the order in which you do missions, but the trade off is a huge amount of variety. I've found myself laughing outloud at some of the game's dialogue and humor, and at other times, jaw on the floor in shock at some of the game's more horrific scenes.The main story can take anywhere between 20 and 50 hours to complete, depending on the extent to which you explore Hope County and its side objectives. It's a wild, memorable ride that will take a seat as one of the series' best. And seriously, without spoiling, Far Cry 5 has an ending you won't soon forget.Far Cry 5 is more of an evolution rather than revolution of the series' signature mechanics. It's a first-person shooter, and contains many of the typical Far Cry / Ubisoft-style gameplay tropes we've come to expect. There are outposts to analyse, raid, and ultimately liberate. There are convoys to sabotage, destroy, and loot. And there are climbing puzzles to traverse and conquer. However, each aspect of the game has been polished and refined, and Ubisoft has thankfully done away with some of the franchise's most annoying aspects.The gunplay in Far Cry 5 is tremendous, and feels as tight and tactical as ever. You can play stealthily, hiding in the dense undergrowth, or go all guns blazing with a flamethrower, burning enemies (and, well, everything) to a crisp. It's still a little odd how gore-averse Ubisoft is, considering how horrific some of the game's imagery is. As a result, sniper rifle shots, explosives, and shotgun blasts might not feel as satisfying as they do in games like Wolfenstein II, but given the sheer mayhem that can unfold at the drop of a hat in Far Cry 5's open world, gore systems would probably turn the game into a ridiculous blood bath, shifting the tone of the game.Indeed, Far Cry 5 features fighter planes, attack helicopters, gun-mounted trucks, and all other sorts of vehicles with which to sew chaos and destruction. The series' signature fire spreading systems return as well, making conflicts immersive and atmospheric.Beyond more conventional vehicles, Far Cry 5's militiamen have constructed a host of customized vehicles almost Mad Max-style, featuring tractors emblazoned with weaponized farm equipment, and armored juggernauts equipped with guns. Your combat options feel virtually limitless as a result, and you can even call upon a roster of unlockable NPC support characters and combat pets to help you in battle. Or hey, you can bring a friend in for some 2-player co-op action too (although, they won't get campaign progress, which is kinda lame).Far Cry 5 refines some of the series' most annoying aspects too, doing away with the Assassin's Creed-style exploration towers. Instead, you will talk to friendly townsfolk you have rescued, find annotated maps, and explore in the old fashioned way to find quests. Additionally, Far Cry 5 does away with the minimap, which might seem frustrating at first (particularly while driving manually), but it keeps your eyes on the game's gorgeous world as a result. You'll become more acquainted with the land itself, rather than the flat topographical circle in the bottom corner, trading convenience for immersion. And I think that's wonderful.Far Cry 5 is truly open world, allowing players to roam to any of the game's three sizable areas as they see fit. You'll build up resistance movements from the local townsfolk in each area, triggering story events that lead up to battles with Joseph Seed's three lieutenants: Faith, John, and Jacob. Beyond the game's main storyline set-pieces, you'll encounter a wide variety of side characters, optional quests, and mini-games, including an awesome fishing system. The game's animal behaviourExploring a Far Cry world has never been more rewarding, putting a stop to the sense of meniality that all-too-often often accompanies open world games.My only criticisms are minor nitpicks that only stand out because the rest of the game is so wonderfully realized. It's annoying how the same button for looting an enemy and swapping to his weapon are placed on the same button, as you'll often drop equipment without meaning to. Also, now that quest leads come from talking to NPCs, it can be frustrating when they suddenly freak out at the sight of an approaching eagle or enemy on the horizon, running away mid-conversation. Additionally, those typical open world glitches are back too, with enemies sometimes glitching through the floor, or wandering around robotically into walls or rocks.Finally, the game's crafting systems still feel tacked on too, allowing you to insta-craft bombs and homeopathic ""boosters"" in the field, from gathered resources. There was an opportunity here to add more survival systems, or perhaps deeper crafting and customization systems, to complement the scrappy makeshift militia warfare taking place in the background. But hey, we can't have everything.Ultimately, Far Cry 5 is a relentlessly fun, aggressively varied open world shooter that will keep you hooked for dozens and dozens of hours. The game's world has never felt more alive, brimming with animal ecosystems, serene lakes, and verdant forests, with spectacular scenery that's just begging to be screenshotted.This is Ubisoft's best open world game since, well, Assassin's Creed Origins, which came out just a few months ago. Ubisoft as a company really seems to be delivering on the promise of ""open world,"" shifting away from the genre's most boring features, while shining a spotlight on the genre's best.I would have liked to have seen Far Cry 5 change things up a little bit more, like Assassin's Creed Origins did, but at this poi,nt I'm truly scraping the barrel of things to complain about. Far Cry 5 is a cover-to-cover classic, fans of Far Cry, or open world sandbox games in general, cannot ignore.

Far Cry 5,Keza MacDonald,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/mar/26/far-cry-5-review-playstation-4-xbox-one-pc-ubisoft,"PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC; UbisoftA mission to save the US from destruction by a charismatic leader flits between flamethrowing fun and graphic torture in a tonally unpredictable visionIn rural Hope County, Montana, an extreme Christian cult has been slowly eroding the power of the state. Its charismatic leader, his body inked with religious iconography and his hair pulled back in a man-bun, has amassed an armed following that feels he can do no wrong. Sent in as part of a team of US marshals to arrest Father Seed, you can feel the tension as you walk through crowds of his jeering followers and into his church; it’s as though everything is about to tip over the edge, and soon enough, it does. Before you can even get into the air with the handcuffed Seed, his followers have shot your helicopter down in flames and dragged your screaming teammates away. After a doomed car chase through the night as you try to escape the county, you’re rescued by a crotchety old survivalist, handed a gun, and told that you are now part of the resistance.The opening is a high point for Far Cry 5. It introduces a great villain, the rather timely premise of saving forgotten America from the brink of disaster, and the kind of seat-of-your-pants action that video games are made for. Afterwards, the sense of purpose quickly dissipates in a meandering journey to liberate the county’s three regions from gun-toting cultists, and the game soon reveals that it is very tonally confused. The story missions, centring around Seed and his siblings, are disquieting and extremely violent, with pretty graphic scenes of torture, indoctrination and religious frenzy; after a while, it gets wearing. Meanwhile, when you’re roaming free in Hope County, you’re clinking beers with hillbillies, tearing down a mountain on a quad bike accompanied by blaring hair-metal and fireworks, hunting down crazed moose or collecting ingredients for a food festival called the Testy Festy (no prizes for guessing the featured dish).It’s emotionally confusing to be buffeted constantly between tense sadism and tongue-in-cheek tomfoolery. Far Cry 5 doesn’t succeed in reconciling these two sides of its personality, but then it doesn’t really try. This is a game in which you will be listening to lurid descriptions of cannibalism and torture on one mission, then tearing down a highway in a monster truck with mounted machine guns the next. To enjoy it, you have to inoculate yourself against these sudden changes in mood.Far Cry 5 is most enjoyable when it embraces the chaos that ensues when a player is left on an island full of hostile cultists with enough guns to embarrass John McClane. Blowing up cultist shrines, liberating farms and factories from their grasp and generally making yourself a flamethrower-toting nuisance is great fun. The characters you can recruit are entertaining caricatures of small-town USA. Planes, boats and road vehicles are all easy and enjoyable to drive and blow up. It’s jarring to be wrenched away from the open world and into a confrontation with one of the Seed siblings, which sometimes happens with no warning – like being briefly kidnapped into a different game entirely.Although beautiful – even breathtaking, especially at sunrise and from the air – rural Montana isn’t as fun to fool around in as Far Cry 3’s tropical island, or 4’s Himalayan mountains. You won’t be busting out a wingsuit and jumping off a mountain very often. This is a more militaristic interpretation of the series’ survival theme: instead of hunting bears and trying to tame the wilds, you’re constantly fighting off fanatics trying to kill or capture you. It’s also harder to sneak around with a bow, throwing knives than to run in all guns blazing, because the cult lieutenants send more and more lackeys after you until you can barely drive half a mile without being pursued by two carfuls of cultists and a fighter plane.Co-operative multiplayer adds another unpredictable element – with two players running around, things are even more likely to go awry and devolve into continually escalating shootouts. Sometimes this chaos is enjoyable; sometimes it’s confusing and frustrating. Occasionally the game forgets where you were and what you were doing before you died and plonks you somewhere random on the map. Other glitches and confusing moments happen when the game’s systems collide; upon approaching a man weeping over the body of what looked like his dead friend, he immediately straightened up, delivered a line of dialogue about some nearby side-mission, and walked off. Radio chatter from other characters sometimes has nothing whatsoever to do with what you’re doing. Story-based missions can completely lose the plot when something unexpected happens, leaving you standing in a field miles away while the action happens elsewhere.Far Cry 5 taps into the prevailing geopolitical sense of being right on the brink of disaster, but it stays well away from the real-world issues that clearly inspired its themes. There are numerous oblique references to Trump – one side-mission has you retrieving a certain infamous, compromising tape for a federal agent who keeps talking about golden showers – but it’s played for laughs rather than political commentary. The Eden’s Gate cultists might be extremists, but they’re emphatically not white supremacists. It comes close to trying to say something, but never actually does – and it’s far more comfortable when it’s being silly than serious, making you wish that it had committed wholeheartedly to playful satire rather than spreading its bets.There are great individual moments in Far Cry 5. The gunplay is excellent, its unpredictable world generates daring stories of accidental heroism, and when it leans into the whole red-blooded American patriotism schtick, it’s genuinely funny. It doesn’t always fit together as well as it should, sometimes forcing the player to work around the game rather than with it – but the wildly vacillating tone is the bigger issue. It’s at once disorienting and noncommittal. Paradoxically, this is an extreme satire of modern America that says pretty much nothing about it."

Far Cry 5,Dave Irwin,Tech Advisor,https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/games/far-cry-5-review-3663128/,"When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence.Far Cry 5 is a rollercoaster of emotions; from the sheer adrenaline of the gameplay, to the psychological trauma resulted from the most disturbing underlings in the series’ history. Much like a pilgrimage, the initial trials and tribulations are very difficult, but as things progress it becomes significantly less so. A hugely enjoyable experience, even if it’s certainly got a few pacing and open-world teething issues to address.Since Ubisoft acquired the rights of the franchise, Far Cry has done a fair bit of globe-trotting in order to find charismatic villains. The Jackal taunted players as they contracted Malaria, Vaas taught us the definition of insanity, and Pagan Min wore some very snazzy suits and swaggered around like a classically trained British actor.The previous games had bandits or a regime to fight against, but Far Cry 5 takes things in perhaps the riskiest direction – a fundamentalist god-fearing cult armed to the teeth, has taken over a small fictional county in Montana, USA. In the current climate, has this risk paid off for Ubisoft?Far Cry 5 is set to be released on 27 March 2018, and will come out on PS4, Xbox One, and PC – with support for both 
PS4 Pro and 
Xbox One X.You can pre-order the game now for £49.99/$59.99 from 
Amazon, 
Steam, the 
PlayStation Store and the 
Microsoft Store. For those looking for it, there’s a “
Digital Deluxe Edition” that comes complete with lots of weapon packs, there’s the “
Gold Edition” that comes with the Digital Deluxe content plus the DLC season pass.If you’d rather buy the game from elsewhere, you can also get the non-digital editions from Amazon, including the 
Father Edition, which throws in a collector’s box, steelbook case, printed map and exclusive figurine. You can also buy the game from 
Game or 
Argos in the UK, or 
GameStop or 
Best Buy in the US, along with plenty of other retailers too.Finally, there are also two other premium editions available from Ubisoft’s store, including the “
Edition Mondo” that includes a vinyl soundtrack and Steelbook case, as well as the “
Hope Country Collector’s Case” which includes everything mentioned above, as well as a physical map and a 45cm Deer Skull in resin.Set in the fictional region of Hope County, Montana, the player takes on the role of a customisable Deputy in the local police force, sent in to arrest the leader of a separatist cult – Eden’s Gate – known as Joseph Seed. Upon his arrest and subsequent escape, it soon becomes apparent that to deliver justice to Joseph, his “Heralds” must be brought down first.While Joseph Seed, or “The Father” as he’s commonly known, certainly has a huge amount of charisma, he just didn’t strike as much of a chord as he barely gets any screen time until the very end. His family however definitely did. By the end of each scenario, I was personally invested in getting vengeance for the horrible things they’d do. I won’t spoil as to why I felt that way, but these three more than made up for the surprising blandness of the main antagonist.As far as the comparisons many will make to current events, there’s a deeper layer beneath the surface. It’s less a narrative against political ideology and more of religious radicalism in all its forms. Joseph is billed as a cult of personality, whose followers believe in his word above all others, and his word is essentially to convert or be purged. At times, it does delve into extremes, but the message is most certainly well framed.Being set in a fictionalised Montana, a rather safe Republican State, does help with the characterisation. Every friendly face that’s a main ally is endearing, from the yokel pilot and his pregnant wife to the man running for office as a Republican candidate, they all hate the “Peggies”  and what they’re doing in the region, which humanises them as a result. Some are delightfully simple-minded, but others give a great deal of wit and sass. As such, when Far Cry 5 attempts humour or sorrow, it hits the mark a surprising number of times.One upside of being set close to the Rockies is that Far Cry 5 looks stunning. Luscious green forests, sprawling lakes, and towering mountains cover the landscape, making every view a breath-taking one. It’s well populated too, with tons of friendly people trying to take their homeland back and cultists trying to kill everyone, but even the local fauna has a huge amount of range from Deer to Bears, and even a few Caribou and Moose. Hope County feels alive and constantly in flux, which makes the world all the more compelling to explore.As one of Ubisoft’s staple open-world games, Far Cry has long had the reputation of having radio towers to climb in order to see the rest of the world. In Far Cry 5, things are done very differently and in a less gamified way. Each hostage rescued from capture will reveal one location, which is then marked on the map. There are also maps in Forts that show a number of locations. It’s certainly going to take some getting used to, but in a way, I preferred having a motivation to help the civilians rather than floor it down the road to get to my next destination.Other than that, the structure feels more open as well. Once the initial island has been liberated, the whole of Hope County is available to explore, though the game heavily encourages players to take out one of the three Heralds. Since Hope County is huge, it’s nice to have each Herald occupy one area of the map as it turns an intimidating prospect and turns it into bite-size chunks – each one having its own missions, its own identity, and its own unique problems for players to face.Starting out though, I was severely outgunned, making some missions significantly harder than they needed to be. But as I progressed through the game, unlocking perks by spending points for completing challenges or picking up magazines, and buying upgraded weapons, I found the game eased off a little bit at a time to make the experience more palatable. Some guns can have Silver Bars (found in-game or bought with microtransactions) listed as a price as well as cash, but in-game money never really was an issue that came up, so they can be easily avoided.That said, one need not go at it alone, and in Far Cry 5 players have the ability to have allies join them. These can be people saved or special characters whose missions have been completed. I found that some were most certainly better than others in that respect, sticking with the same bunch of allies throughout, though depending on play style this could be different for everyone.Each segment of the map has an awareness bar of sorts that rises for each of the three Heralds as missions are completed, operations disrupted, and civilians saved. Upon hitting certain points, the game takes a break from the open-world segments in order to show off more of the story, and the three Heralds themselves. It’s an odd design decision that by the end felt like it was going through a formula, and yet I found I didn’t mind a great deal. Culminating in an encounter with said Herald that always feels unique and tailored to them, it’s as if I was playing three mini-Far Cry games in one.When not out liberating the land from cultists, there are plenty of other side activities to carry out: Hunting animals, base jumping with a wingsuit, mimicking a stuntman, and even fishing. Few give tangible rewards unless the skins of certain animals are required in a mission, but everything that is done can grant perk points in order upgrade abilities.Being an open-world experience, there’s a certain amount of bone-idleness one would expect from the AI. Far Cry 5’s enemy AI can be relatively sharp, attempting to flank to gain the advantage; yet the friendly AI can be denser than a ton of bricks. I frequently saw friendlies running over other friendlies at full pelt, and the amount of times my Bear friend – Cheeseburger – got run over by supposed allies was upsetting to count.As for bugs though? Far Cry 5 had very few, if any, in my experience with the game. I also found running on a standard PS4, the game maintained sharp visuals but ran at a capped 30FPS. Experiences elsewhere, either enhanced on Xbox One X and PS4 Pro, or on a higher-end PC, will likely be significantly improved since the hardware is more powerful, but it certainly wasn’t the worst experience in the world on the base PS4.Those wishing to play with other players can buddy up in cooperative play, allowing for pretty much the entire game to be played in this way. The caveat here though is that only the host’s progress in the campaign will be saved, so unless friends doesn’t mind helping for little reward, it might be a hard sell for them to play with them.On top of all of that, Ubisoft has also included “Far Cry Arcade”, which doubles as a challenge mode combined with community level editing. Maps can have either single player, cooperative, or multiplayer focus in mind, invoking a level of customisation normally reserved by Halo’s Forge mode. If I had one minor complaint here, it would be that there’s little room for customising multiplayer beyond standard Deathmatch modes, allowing for crazier multiplayer options. It’s otherwise a very robust level editor and can be used to create some really compelling maps.PhonesLaptopsTabletsWearable TechHome TechSecurityDigital Magazine - SubscribeNewsletters"
Far Cry 5,Rob Larkin,Gaming Nexus,https://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/5646/Far-Cry-5/,"Far Cry 5 kicks off with the same formula most of the series seems to have embraced: putting you face to face with the big bad in the opening scene. Taking a page out of Far Cry 4, there's even an option in that scene to do nothing and let the credits roll. It's classic Far Cry everywhere you look: the weapon load outs are similar, nature abounds and wild animals inhabit every wooded area to clash with the scores of enemy soldiers, bases are there to be liberated, animals there to be skinned, vehicles to drive. This time you can choose a female character to run the game with and the crafting from animal parts has been eliminated, restricting crafting to just simple bomb making. In its place skins can be exchanged for cash to purchase upgrades. And there you have it: Far Cry 5, it's Far Cry 4 but set in Montana so capitalism has replaced crafting and equal rights have opened the doors to finally allow a woman to take the lead role of silent protagonist, driving the story but having nothing to say in it.Far Cry 5 does not push this series forward as much as it fully embraces the unscripted chaos that was its predecessors greatest success. It is a car crash of missions, factions, wilderness, and random spawns and events. But it does so somewhat to its own detriment. There is a plot in place, but it's pretty standard stuff: Cult takes over Hope County, Montana; cuts off access to outside world; and you serve as the spear point of the resistance to take back the region. The narrative focuses on the cult leader and the sadistic members of his family that make up his band of lieutenants. Ferret out and defeat each one to eventually work your way up the chain. The entire map layout and open world progression system is lifted directly from Ghost Recon: Wildlands. Come to think of it, so is a lot of the plot. Do whatever open world activities you want in each of the lieutenant's regions to fill your meter and force those junior confrontations. Clear all the areas to force the final showdown. Story mission activities provide more progression but any activity will reap at least some small progress. And that's where the game ultimately both suffers and succeeds: there is just so much going on it becomes problematic to do, well, anything.Standing between point A and point B on any travel itinerary is an endless stream of random encounters constantly begging for your attention. Want to kick off the next story mission? Oh look, a tanker truck! Blow that up for some quick easy progression points. And over there! A townsperson has been pulled over by a cultist and is about to be executed, better save 'em. Of course on your way you just ran into a checkpoint and they're shooting. Take cover behind those trees. Oh wait! Behind those trees was another random encounter with more cultists, now you're being shot at on two fronts. Thankfully a cougar also just happened to be behind the trees as well and now everyone is getting mauled by it. There a constant stream of goings on that I really believe was an intentional ploy to try and recreate those magic little moments when it comes together perfectly. When you blow up an exploding barrel that was next to a caged bear and now a flaming bear is rampaging around the enemy base doing most of your work for you. But what it ends up being in practice is a whole lot of noise that actually bogs the game down. The game's biggest issue is the overpopulated world. It's a little less messy on the fringes but for the most part there are so many little inconsequential sideshows constantly barraging the screen it ends up a chore just to move forward from one mission end to the next mission start. You literally do run into some new skirmish only to take cover right into the lap of another new skirmish. It tries to force those magical moments of Far Cry bliss when these unscripted events come together in the most delightful ways but mostly it's just maddening, especially for a guy with a review deadline. For the first time in a game that I can ever remember, I ended up fully embracing fast travel. I usually hate fast travel. I feel it cheats me out of the whole experience. No matter what the distance I always want my character to go at it the old fashioned way, but in FC5 there was just too many distractions between A and B that fast travel became a necessity.Another way the overpopulation really hurts the game is when these events interrupt the long and drawn out little dialog expositions that must be listened to in full to actually kick off any mission or gain any intel. The NPCs doling out these gems suffer the same incessant barrage of random encounters that follow your character, so they must often halt mid sentence and deal with some new conflict of their own. A cultist truck slowly drones by a resistance outpost and now you're got a full firefight to resolve before you can hear that last sentence of the loot drop location. I once had a helicopter that was particularly timely three times bombard a critical mission giving NPC, twice causing him to hop on a nearby ATV and just completely bug out from the mission area. I had to reload the area with fast travel just to get him to respawn back in place only to see the sad little melodrama play out again when our helicopter dropped in on the scene a second time. On the third attempt I had an RPG leveled right at the helicopter spawn to finally down them before they could fire off their first round and spook the NPC.There is one real way this game does move the series forward is the companion system. It's more or a less a stand in for co-op in a single player environment. Three low level rando guns for hire can be employed as travelling companions or choose on the 9 specialist that have much more powerful perks. To be honest, too powerful. Specialist are basically an easy button, offering things like dead aim sniping, near constant air support, or even bears and cougars on demand, oh my! The biggest strategic purpose companions serve is the ability to revive you if you've fallen and they are still standing. Which is particularly nice when you run into a cheap death like hitting the wrong button to eject yourself from a speeding automobile or blowing said auto up because you accidentally tried to commit vehicular homicide on an enemy wearing a large exploding flamethrower fuel cell for a backpack.I would also be remiss not to mention Far Cry Arcade. At first it was a mode that was entirely uninteresting to me and I filed it away in my mind as a gimmick before I ever even played it. I have no interest in creating my own levels and even less in playing the typical dross that other players would create. However, being a good reviewer knew I had to at least give it a try and actually came out impressed. Technically the service still needs some work. Loading times are a mess: it takes too long to get into the main menu, takes too long to load up a map, takes too long to even vote on the map after the fact, and then takes too long to get back into the main menu. The worst sin of all is the time it takes to reload a map that was just failed, basically it has to repopulate the thing from square one. Fail a mission there is no quick jumping back in to have another go. Those assets you were just enjoying, yeah they all need to come back in from scratch, please hold...But functionally Far Cry Arcade is a triumph on two levels. Firstly, because it provides the stage for a robust competitive multiplayer element the base game can only do in co-op. But even more so because it provides a space to play Far Cry without all the random encounters getting in the way. It's a little slice of scripted tranquility in the sea of madness.Some quick hits to send us out: Far Cry 5, overall is a very good looking game. It fleshes out the back country of Montana well. It suffers from the same bugs you've probably come to expect of a game of this size and pedigree. Occasionally NPCs clip badly into the environment, occasionally they don't spawn in correctly. It's usually things that a little fast travel will reset the environment so it all lines up properly again. The plot is not its strong suit. It's ripped from common gaming tropes with a few forced and ham-fisted excuses thrown in to bring you up close and personal with the cult leader and his lieutenants from magic bullets that knock you out to opening a door and there's someone on the other end waiting to knock you out to dream sequences. When you can get from one mission to the next it all progresses pretty quickly. Most of the NPCs are just there with little backstory and less development. A few get their stories told better than others, but even some of the seemingly major ones are really just vending machines for missions and information. It also has all the extra Ubisoft bloat packed in as well, Uplay and Ubisoft Club are both on hand and eager to pop up messages onscreen to reward you for your progression. But who really uses that stuff anyway? And finally there are lots of little cross promotions and Easter eggs from the pee tape to Red Dawn references to a jackalope sitting in a field to kick off a dream sequence. It's all in there.Overall, it's a fun ride and good for a few laughs. Game play and gunplay are solid, what you'd expect from a Far Cry game. It has a little bit of everything: single player, co-op, multiplayer, level creator, scripted missions, random events, and many ways to approach it all. I'm not sure if it really does any of that at the top of the genre, but it does each bit well enough to be enjoyed on its own. A jack of all trades, master of none type experience. Don't come for the plot or social commentary because it's not pretentious enough to really try and say anything. Do come for that rare bit of magic when it all comes together. Far Cry 5, for better and worse, is just a collision of events that sometimes creates beautiful moments out of the chaos. It has a plot that does not drive it. It dares not to make any commentary on the actions of its antagonists less the actions of the protagonists immediately drown the whole narrative under its hypocrisy. It is simply a vehicle for violence and hi-jinks, an excuse to shoot stuff, drive stuff, blow stuff up, shoot some more stuff, and then watch a bear come out of nowhere an maul that last thing you were about to shoot. If you embrace the madcap, if you let go of expectations of narrative and plot and just give in to the cult of Far Cry, then there is a lot of entertainment to be had. It's not a game I would describe as good so much as entertaining. A stoner's paradise of silly action and happenstance. That's the level on which it truly works and can be enjoyed. I doubt anyone is going to put Far Cry 5 on their best of 2018 lists, but most people are going to run into enough moments when the car crash of random events come together and produce something unscripted and memorable of which they will be glad for the experience.* The product in this article was sent to us by the developer/company. First picked up a game controller when my mother bought an Atari 2600 for my brother and I one fateful Christmas.   Now I'm a Software Developer in my day job who is happy to be a part of the Gaming Nexus team so I can have at least a flimsy excuse for my wife as to why I need to get those 15 more minutes of game time in...

Far Cry 5,Glen Fox,Push Square,http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/far_cry_5,"GuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpFar Cry 52018 7.6Game RatingUser Ratings: 113Our Review: Scroll DownDaddy issuesVersion Reviewed: PS4 Pro / EuropeanIf an AI were to create a game based on popular Google search terms for video games, Far Cry 5 would likely be the result. Whether that's a good or a bad thing largely depends on what you expect from Far Cry at this point, and probably games in general.Because Far Cry 5 isn't a bad game – in fact, it's an awful lot of good old fashioned fun. But it doesn't do anything you haven't seen before, and the core loop is incredibly repetitive. Long time series fans will bemoan the lack of survival mechanics, too, and they'd be right. It's probably the most criminal aspect.Especially when the opening cutscene sets you up for such a thrilling experience. You play as a rookie cop who's sent in to help arrest the leader of a religious cult. On the chopper ride there, the local sheriff, a US marshal, and a deputy fill you in on the happenings so far.The scene is terrifically set. The sheriff is clearly terrified and suggests you turn around multiple times. Meanwhile, you can clearly see that the cult isn't to be messed around with. There's basically an army of them and they've taken over an entire state. Three cops in a chopper feel very ill equipped to deal with the situation.This all culminates in an incredibly tense arrest while cult members surround and jeer you. It's terrifying, and very reminiscent of Resident Evil 4. Soon enough, everything goes wrong and you're running for your life, hiding amongst the trees trying to seek out a weapon as a mad cult chases you.If things remained this tense, we'd be in for a real treat. But soon enough you're in an action-fuelled car chase, mowing down hordes of cultists like it's Call of Duty or Uncharted. This sets the tone for the rest of the experience, which is a goofy, balls out action game of shooting cultists, blowing stuff up, and driving really fast.To Ubisoft's credit, it's all incredibly slick and competent. The guns are satisfying, the explosions more so, and you don't have to learn a thing to pilot a chopper, quad bike, or jeep. They just work, and handle really well.The core loop is less satisfying. You have to form a resistance in three different areas so you don't have to fight an army by yourself. This involves the usual Far Cry stuff of attacking outposts, as well as destroying cult property, rescuing civilians, and killing VIP targets. Each of the three areas is controlled by a lieutenant, and killing each of them is your ultimate goal. To lure them out, you have to gain three levels of resistance in the area they control, which forces a showdown. Each time you gain a level, you also have a mini face off, which gives you an opportunity to learn more about them, the cult, and the big bad boss who calls himself ""The Father"".The cult's reasoning is more interesting than you'd expect, and is tied into very real political events. It might even hit a nerve if you can lose yourself in all of the melodrama, but ultimately it's all just a little too far-fetched to get its claws into the most scrupulous of players. It doesn't help that the villains feel ripped right out of a Batman Arkham game, and spend so much time trying to convince you that they're not crazy while staring far too intensely into your eyes. If we could accuse a video game character of over-acting, we'd level that complaint at all of the villains here.Aside from the main stuff, there's a bunch of side quests to complete, like Tony Hawk-inspired stunts to perform, collectibles and treasure to seek out, and henchmen to hire. You can even hunt animals, fish, or take on wingsuit glides if you're not feeling a gunfight. Most of this stuff rewards you with cash you can spend on new weapons, modifications, vehicles, and outfits.While this all culminates in a a ton of initial fun, it all starts to run a little thin about two thirds in. Despite Ubisoft's clear efforts to tackle it, ultimately there's just not enough variety, and the occasional goofy quest to hunt down bull genitals for a ""Testy Festy"" just doesn't cut it.It doesn't help that the design doesn't encourage you to use many of the game's features. Attacking a cult outpost is as exciting as you make it, but once you've settled on the easiest method of tackling it, why would you make it more difficult for yourself? Aside from a few easy challenges that reward perk points, there's no encouragement to experiment, and that's a shame because there's so much to experiment with here.What does help, though, is that you can play almost the entire game in co-op, with a friend taking on the role of hired help. It's so much more fun working together to tackle an outpost without setting off a single alarm that you'll wonder how you ever played Far Cry without it.Then there's Far Cry Arcade, the true multiplayer component. Here you can create and play a variety of challenge maps with your friends, and level up your multiplayer level. We can't imagine many will bother with it, and we can't help but feel like Ubisoft has missed a trick by not including a Battle Royale multiplayer mode. Far Cry just seems such a right fit for it.The best thing we can say about Far Cry 5 is that it's competent, and the worst that it's far too safe. Ubisoft is clearly more interested in making an experience that appeals to everyone to satisfy the bottom line. That's a real shame, because there are the makings of a highly entertaining sandbox survival adventure here. Sadly, you won't see any of it, because there's no encouragement to experiment when running and gunning is as effective as it is.Good 7/10Scoring PolicyReview copy provided by UbisoftPlease note that some external links on this page are affiliate links, which means if you click them and make a purchase we may receive a small percentage of the sale.

I was having loads of fun with 4 until I saw it for what it was and never played it again.Helpful review. I'm going to wait for this game to be marked down.Far Cry is probably one of my most guilty pleasures, in that I 100% completed 2, 3 and 4 but to be honest, I was pretty exhausted by the format by the end of 4 and skipped primal. I had a quick play at EGX and it looked nice, as they all do, but felt very familiar. I had hoped for some real variation or less busy work.I will probably get it, maybe on XB for the Coop play with a friend but certainly not a launch. Especially since FC games tend to drop quicker then an overly hormonal teenagers knackers.Pre-ordered the Gold edition as the DLC and Far Cry 3 bonus looked more interesting than Far Cry 5. Still should get some 'fun' from the main game...The gameplay trailers looked choppy, but will be #1 next week.I'm currently playing ghost recon wildlands and I'm disappointed because there's a severe lack of variety, and it looks like this game has those same problems. So sad as I immensely enjoyed FC3 but found FC4 to be boring. Maybe I'll get this when it gets a hefty discount.I got mine today. This is the first FC game I play so even if it is just a ""reskin"", it is new to me. Great graphics and the story seems good, but too early to have a fair opinion""Each of the three areas is controlled by a lieutenant, and killing each of them is your ultimate goal. To lure them out, you have to gain three levels of resistance in the area they control, which forces a showdown"".     —  sounds like a cut and paste from ghost recon wildlands to me.   ubisoft seem to have crow-barred every mechanic from all their open word games into each other that they're all becoming less distinctive, and more repetitive.  i've watched the opening hour of this on tube, and it looked dull, and i've never liked the idea for the premiss of the story in the first place.   shame, because some of the dlc sounds way more interesting..  the alien bug hunting one sounds like the kind of decent starship troopers game that was never made.  (i know there was blacksite area 51, but it was rubbish).What a disappointment! Safe? This seemed to be over the top crazy and they played it safe?Shame on you Ubisoft! Far Cry 4 was a fun game but even that felt repetitive...so I don't get why they don't try something new! Maybe more linear missions with crazier elements...The DLC now sounds way better than this!Sounds like if you've played far cry 4, you've played this, shame really. Anyone know if the dlc is standalone? The Vietnam dlc looked cool.Sounds like pretty much exactly what I wanted.Somehow I have made it through life without playing a single Far Cry game.  This looked interesting, but maybe I’ll wait or just play FC4 for like $10.  I kept thinking they’d put it for free on PS plus.  Either way, I’ve got other games holding my attention atm.I'm not sure why anyone would want survival aspects added to a far cry game, it's pretty clear they're chasing the 80's and 90's blockbuster action movie feel since the third entry. I'm just glad there's full campaign co-op, really looking forward to that!Most reviews I've seen for this so far are pretty much what I was expecting...more of the usual FC gameplay - with a few tweaks - in a new setting. Most are giving it average/good scores (it's current PS4 metacritic rating is 81) I finished FC 3 & 4 so will no doubt get plenty of fun from this too. Have pre-ordered the Gold edition from Amazon, which should hopefully come tomorrow.@Cpt_Price you know Ubisoft hasn't released a complete edition or goty edition in a long time now their gold edition is what took their place.Got this game very cheap, used some loyalty points at the site I usually buy at, so won't be losing too much on trying it out.Only just played an hour or two, graphics are great and it feel pretty fluid and running is fast, something I like when the game is one BIG openworld sandbox game.Thanks for the review! Big fan of FC3, but I was somewhat disappointed by 4 & Primal, so I’ll pick this up once it’s been heavily discounted. Doesn’t seem like it’s the revolution I was hoping for  .Great review.I'll probably get it when it's on sale, and knowing Ubisoft games, they're usually on sale pretty quick after release.if you want a hard survial game play metal gear survial you cant waste a thing food is very time consuming to get looking forward to far cry 5 cant beat a bit of gun runI have a question!I heard somewhere that you don't have to hunt animals to create bags etc etc...but does this game still have perks? Cause if there's no character progression it's a sale for me I thinkI played 1,2 and 3 finished the 1 and 2 completely but quit half way through 3 as I found it boring. 4 looked like 3 in a different area of the world, 5 just look like it's set in a open world town than looks exactly like 3 and 4. Plus the idea of having to lure an enemy out that is pure wildlands right there@kyleforrester87 in what way did you see it for what it was? I'm interested because I've never played a FC game and am considering purchasing the FC4/Primal joint pack in the Easter Sale. Would you recommend against it? Or would a first time player like me enjoy it?@AFCC There are still plenty of perks, don't worry! It's all tied into challenges which you have to complete for perk points. It's a relatively deep system, so if you like that stuff you'll be pleased.You can still hunt animals too, but it's purely for cash this time around. Welp@tomassi It was the first FC game I played since 1 (and a little tiny bit of 2 but I don't think that counts) and I was having a lot of fun for 15-20 hours or so, then the penny dropped and I realised I was just brainlessly running from way point to way point ticking boxes.Still, these games clearly aren't terrible as they tend to average 8/9 out of 10's so it's a personal taste thing more than anything.FC4 has got to be worth a punt if you are not sure considering how cheap it is these days.@kyleforrester87 I often hear people about ticking off boxes, but that's not at all how I experienced it. The strength of the game is all about switching things up, playing it creatively. The game has a lot of systems to offer and different ways to approach each base. Sure, if you're approaching every base in the same way it might get boring, but that's not really what FC4 was about in my opinion. Anyway, to each their own.@kyleforrester87 OK man, I may do it. I always see it for about £12 in the sale, but then again, maybe it will even appear on Plus at some point, so I can afford to leave it for a while yet. Massive backlog of games as it is!!@FoxyGlen I like that you only hunt if you want to, but still expected more rewards than just cash!I do like the perk system in Far Cry so I'm happy with that! I'm on the fence about this one...some very good reviews and some very mediocre ones...hard choice nowOnly 7?? I still have to play it, but I watched over 3 hours of gameplay.I usually dont watch gameplay for most games, but this one really got me hooked. The AI is the only thing that doesnt totally convince me. The way the mission objectives are made, and how you can get to the area boss, is simply superb. Farcry 5 is the reason I'm buying a PS4 Pro again.I hope this game does well, It's obvious a lot of work went into it.@Kidfried i get that, but against say MGS5 it just didn't inspire me in the same way to play it like that.This is my problem with most Ubisoft games in general, sure they aren't bad by any means but most of them usually boil down to completing everything on the map to progress and after so many games with that type of gameplay it does start to feel tired, hence why I haven't bought a game of theirs in several years. If a new Splinter Cell is announced this year at E3 like the rumors suggest that will likely change, I love that series.Sounds like a, far cry, from the series' best. Sorry.I'll wait till this hit PsPlus like Far Cry 4GLet us not forget MG: Survive 8/10@Melucine Hey, I'm happy for you! I hope you enjoy it. Be sure to turn off the mini-map for the best experience (in all the other games, I just ended up staring at it constantly, even looking at it more during gunfights than at the rest of the screen)!Like others, I'm burned out of this series, so I'll be skipping it...I hope this is the last time they make FarCry 3 with a different skin!@smelly_jr Thanks! I don't know if there is an option for it, I play with default options, but there is no mini map. Also unlike other Ubisoft open world games I have palyed, there is no ""tower"" to unlock the map, so at least this is something new.Well i liked Primal and Farcry 3 so i think i still gonna get it. 😁 On my other site they really liked the game. And with this review does not sound to terrible. 😉@kyleforrester87 That's fair I guess!Looks like FC3 is going to remain my series high point then...The setting seems interesting but I think I've had enough of the Far Cry formula for now. Will buy when it's a tenner or something. Played Watch Dogs 2 recently and really enjoyed it. Ubi tried new stuff there and I think it really paid off.Great review!Only played Primal (which was awesome) and got FC5 deluxe with €30 off so I think I'll be enjoying 5 a lot. Only drawback would be the repetitive fetch quests but I'll work my way through.@FoxyGlen: Is it possible to complete the story first and play on after to collect all other trophies? And are there any missable trophies I need to keep my eye on in particular?I want this game, but I will wait for a sale.Was bored of the game format halfway through FC3, fair to say i'll be giving this a wide berth, even on a sale.I want FC5 to be a game i like. If for me it bcomes my second favorite FC game behind FC3 then it should be enjoyable to play.From the promo videos FC5 looks like stupid fun. I like stupid fun.""we can't help but feel like Ubisoft has missed a trick by not including a Battle Royale multiplayer mode""Thank god for that. Far Cry is about lengthy FPS single-player campaigns in an open world, and is one of the few remaining games to cater for the audience which wants that. No need whatsoever to copy what everyone else is doing. All online shooters devolve into the same thing... play one and you've played them all. Credit to Ubi for not following the herd.What is with the promo screen shots? Was there no gameplay ones available?I really enjoyed FC4 but felt kinda burnt out from the series. This review and others have yet to convince me this is a worthwhile purchase.I only played Far Meh 3 and it was deadly easy even on the hardest difficulty. I had to put a piece of paper on the TV to hide the minimap, still a mindless shoot shoot shoot...@Cpt_Price oh I agree with you about open world fatigue. I have so many games I keep bouncing off of because they are open world and so time consuming and it bothers me because I used to never leave a game before beating it. I've been finding myself going back to older linear games to cleanse my system from all these open world games and it seems to be helpingi cant help myself ill be buying it today, that intro sounded insane but i stopped reading for spoilers lol@Dpishere Definitely agree with you here. Ubisoft has clearly settled on a formula that works for them and sells, but it leaves a lot of us with burnout. Just makes me respect devs like Bethesda even more. We might not get a new game from them for 6 years, but you know it's going to be a completely different experience.@FoxyGlen Yes Bethesda has been one of my favorite developers since Morrowind, in my mind they can't make a bad game. Too bad we most likely won't get a new Elder Scrolls for another couple years because I think most people are ready to move on from Skyrim, and that game was released way back in 2011. Either way hopefully they have something cool to be excited for this year.I’ll wait for a drop, it’ll be half price by the end of next week.1/10 from me, it was so short completed in not even 10 minutes, I saw no action whatsoever. I choose to not arrest Joseph Seed, walked out the door, credits rolled... aw well may as well trade it in for something else.EDIT: Sarcasm aside, after putting in over 10 hours so far this is the best game I’ve played this year so far, it’s now a 9/10 from me (reserving the 10/10 for RDR2 😉)OK serious question, i have only ever played FC3 and it was OK, do you think this one is worth getting for a person who isn't well versed in the franchise?Although generally the reviews have been good I’ve found some of the more negative reviews strange. Was anyone actually expecting anything other than what far cry 5 has in fact offered. I don’t know, maybe that’s why I’m enjoying it so much. Even with that amazing opening scene I never once prepared myself for anything other than driving around and shooting.@MaccaMUFC you must have not played ni no uni 2@Th3solution I think you should take Farcry 3 good fun. 😁@FullbringIchigo played 2 and hated it. Played 3 and gave up as it was boring.Skipped 4 and primal, and finished 5 today. About 25 hours or so and I had a great time. It's nothing revolutionary, but has a lot of laugh out loud moments and some really horrible scenes. It's fun, and with a friend in co op it's even more so.A bit of advice; there's two people you can get as guns for hire who'll do missions with you. Ones a senators son and one is a nutter with a flamethrower. The dialogue between them is genius. They'll chat to each other randomly.

Far Cry 5,Kai Powell,Wccftech,https://wccftech.com/review/far-cry-5-open-world-bliss/,"Quietly behind the scenes of Hope County, Montana, a religious zealot has been amassing power and forming a cult so strong, that even the US Government has little chance of taking it down. Project at Eden’s Gate and its followers, colloquially known as Peggies, have been making life a bit of a hell for the citizens that don’t wish to join its ranks. The leader of the cult, Father Joseph Seed, marks one of the Far Cry series’ most believable bad guys, a charismatic leader whose sins he wears proudly upon his flesh. Far Cry 5 marks the series return in a few years and the setting couldn’t possibly be closer to home.The open fields and wooded back-paths of Hope County, Montana are best explored with a partner, and even if you’re not the social type of player to hop online, there’s always someone that’s got your back. As the Deputy, you’re going to need as much help as you can get to stand a chance against the PEG elite. Accompanying the Deputy can be one or two Guns for Hire, a new system that’s been implemented into Far Cry 5, giving the player incredible freedom to deciding whether to balance their fighting style or take some squadmates that complement each other nicely. Want someone that can bring in a chopper at a moment's notice, or maybe someone that can keep a much lower profile and act as a huntress in the night? What about a pair of belching, hormonal dudes that are as raunchy as they are explosive in combat? That, my friends, can be yours with the power of Yes. And, of course, Boomer is always willing to join the Deputy on their hikes through the mountain passes as the best of boys.Far Cry’s formulaic design to an open world has been well established for a few games now: climb towers to expand your horizons, hunt and skin animals for crafting materials, and slowly chip away at a region’s influence to weaken the antagonist’s hold on the area. Much of the framework to the design still stays true in Far Cry 5, but it’s clear that the teams at Ubisoft have learned to break free from those established conventions. Save for one tower climbed purely to be self-referential, the player is going to have to put in some footwork to get a feel for Hope County. The occasional map and travel guide can add new points of interest to the map, but there’s no longer a need to climb to the highest point and synchronize to one’s surroundings. Skinning animals has equally been streamlined; while animals can be hunted and skinned, their pelts are merely used to trade in for new cash. Instead, perks are regularly earned by way of the occasional treasure hunt or basic combat challenges. Perks are then spent on permanent upgrades including health and ammo capacity increases that can also carry over into Far Cry Arcade, so it’s certainly worth it to take an extra moment and find a new fishing hole you haven’t tried before.Before the Father, Joseph Seed, can be faced, one must first eliminate his three Heralds, each member of his family that controls a third of Hope County. Each region hides their leader well and it takes a certain amount of resistance to make them come out from hiding. Instead of merely being forced into completing story missions back to back, the player has the freedom to wreak as much havoc as their want to force an encounter. Just about every roaming patrol, every outpost in need of liberation, and every death-defying Clutch Nixon run will contribute to this in record time. Far Cry 5 is a lesson learned in not wasting the player’s time to keep the story going and there’s little need to 100% the open world if all you’re looking for is a climax to one of Ubisoft’s most deranged set of antagonists. Each of the three Heralds harbor their own sins and are perhaps even more psychotic than that of Vaas or Pagan Min, each driven into a certain madness by their blind faith to the Father.For being an open world, Far Cry 5 is incredibly accommodating to any given playstyle to approaching combat. The gunplay feels properly weighted and weapons each have a nice amount of kick that makes gunfights feel as powerful as they look; even the few times melee combat is necessary has a nice heft to swinging a metal pipe into a peggies’ cranium. As the player’s greatest sin is that of Wrath, there’s never a peaceful solution to making it out of Hope County in one piece. Instead, it comes down to just how loudly the player wishes their presence to be known. Going in guns blazing can often be an effective solution, just as long as you’re willing to handle a few alarms and extra reinforcements when taking back an outpost. The silent approach is often the easiest way to go; between distracting guards away from their posts and delivering a quick one-hit kill from a silenced firearm, this is often the least messy approach to take.Hope County is a site of pure bliss and beauty, with idyllic mountain backdrops and a landscape that hasn’t been touched by modern gentrification. I fell in love with simply picking a direction and heading off without any purpose, letting the rolling hills be my guide as I looked off into the distance for another point of interest. Even as roaming groups of Peggies would patrol the streets seeking my head, there were serene moments of simply taking in the fresh air and engaging in a bit of fly fishing to contrast with the action. For the first time in the Far Cry series, Far Cry 5 adds in co-op gameplay that doesn’t feel like merely an extra mode, but rather something that can add to the core experience. From the Deputy’s first steps off of Dutch’s Island, the entire map of Hope County can be explored with a friend. Without limitations of being gated out of story missions, both players can explore the landscape at their own pace and still feel like they’re making progression. While only the host can get credit for completing a given mission, both players can chip away at the various collectible trophies and perks while creating some memorable stories to tell their drinking buddies back home. It’s too bad that the co-op is limited to friends only on PS4 with no option to invite strangers and perhaps make a new friend.Far Cry 5’s other massive addition to the multiplayer landscape is the addition of Far Cry Arcade. You won’t be able to get very far in Hope County without running across an arcade machine advertising this side content, but it can just as easily be accessed through the main menu whenever you want. One half of the multiplayer content is the usual assortment of deathmatch and competitive modes which seemed standard for most FPS titles and sadly, I was only able to take part in a couple of matches in the days leading up to review (without bots, players are forced to wait for 6 players to join up, something I suspect won’t be an issue whatsoever after launch). The second half to Far Cry ‘s multiplayer offerings is in the suite of user-generated maps and content that make up the majority of Far Cry Arcade. From combat arenas to guided exploration journeys, there’s a rather eclectic mixture of new content that players can dive into with tools simple enough to create something new at a moment’s notice. Players aren’t just limited to the fields of Montana in the toolbox and I found some decayed urban landscapes to explore through that would’ve been right at home in a sequel to The Last of Us. I could see myself hopping in and checking out new maps as more and more content creators start to get their hands on Far Cry 5; the potential is strong here.At times, Far Cry 5 carefully treads the line of being topical with its themes into the geopolitical landscape. Much more than simply fighting with angry cultists, the citizens of Hope County are looking to the Deputy to solve any and all problems in their daily life. Unfortunately, these problems are quite irregular and often range somewhere between tracking down lost keys all the way to tracking down a certain ‘pee tape’ that’s popped up in modern news. In all the midst of hallelujahs and hails of bullets, I wasn’t quite expecting the level of crude and raunchy humor that was going to tag along with some of the Guns for Hire.Far Cry 5 doesn’t strike me as a reformation of a series formula that has worked well for years, but rather a baptismal into something new. It can be hard for Ubisoft to wash away the sins of open-world game design, yet there’s the beginning of something greater to behold in Hope County. Whether making the trip to Hope County alone or with friends, the idyllic scenery makes such a stark contrast to the action of a Far Cry title that it’s going to be impossible to fly over and skip this one.On a technical note, our preliminary tests on PC indicate that performance is solid and gameplay is smooth; we'll have a thorough benchmark analysis available later today. Below you can find a gameplay footage captured at 4K resolution on a PC powered by i7 6700K & GTX 1080Ti (without the Game Ready optimized drivers, which should become available in a few hours).Reviewed on PS4 Pro and tested on PC (codes provided by the publisher). You may purchase the game via Amazon.If you're wondering whether bringing the madness to our doorstep, making the entire campaign co-op and including an impressive toolbox to create new levels and missions while still retaining that visceral gunplay the series is known for keeps Far Cry 5 fresh and worth playing on Day One, my answer is: yes, absolutely.Subscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox© 2023 WCCF TECH INC.

Far Cry 5,Garri Bagdasarov,PlayStation Universe,https://www.psu.com/reviews/far-cry-5-review-ps4/," Garri Bagdasarov / March 26, 2018Far Cry 5 is easily my favorite Far Cry title to date. Taking what made the franchise good and streaming it is something I had wanted from the franchise for awhile now. A plethora of missions, a massive world to explore, great cast of characters, and an Arcade mode that adds infinite replayability.Far Cry 5 takes places in the fictional Hope County, Montana where a cult calling itself Eden’s Gate has expanded to every corner of the county. After some leaked footage of the cult’s leader Joseph Seed seemingly gouging out the eyes of a young man the government sends in a US Marshal to arrest Joseph Seed.You take control of a rookie cop sent in with a US Marshal and the Sheriff of Hope County to take Joseph Seed into custody. As you may imagine things don’t go according to plan as you must fight off the cult and escape from their clutches. An intense chase sequence ensues where you’re rescued by a man named Dutch who’s building a resistance to take down the cult.Joseph Seed is easily the best villain the franchise has ever created. His incredible charisma and way with words almost has you believing what he’s preaching. It’s a shame though that his presence, though constantly in the background through radios and loudspeakers, doesn’t appear throughout the story sequences as much as I would have hoped.In order to get to Joseph Seed, you must rid the county of the cults hold on it. Hope County is separated into three regions. Each region is controlled by one of Joseph Seeds siblings. John Seed: a lawyer who has helped the cult seize valuable land throughout the county. Jacob Seed: Head of security and main recruiter for the cult. Faith Seed: A half-sibling, who uses her Bliss flowers to loosen the mind of the populace making them susceptible to suggestion.Each of the siblings controls a region of Hope County. In order to get to Joseph Seed, the resistance with your aid must liberate each region from Joseph’s control.Hope County is a gorgeous location to explore and feels more alive than past Far Cry titles. The farm land, the small town communities, and even the large spaces of forest and mountain ranges just feel alive with activity. The music is also a stand out with both original and licensed music; my favorites are the folk songs that just enrich the world building.Far Cry 5 is an open-world game much like its predecessors. Hope County itself is massive and there is always something for you to do. Far Cry 5 has well over a hundred missions and side missions to take part of. In order to free regions of the cults control you must rescue civilians who are being taking against their will for conversion, liberating cult outposts, and destroying cult propaganda.Far Cry 5 has gone away from the watch towers that you had to climb to unlock points of interest on the map. This time around information is relayed from rescuing civilians and liberating outposts. Every time you liberate an outpost the resistance moves in to take control of it opening up new quests, shops, and fast travel points.Your liberation of each region comes in the form of a resistance meter. Any time you rescue civilians, stop cultist transport vehicles, liberate outposts, and complete missions you earn points on the resistance meter. There are four major points in the resistance meter. Once you reach each point the head of the region will reach out to you to warn you that they are coming for you and they have taken notice of your activities.These warnings set up some really cool scenarios as the region’s leader will send out a hunting squad to track you down and capture you. You can of course fight them off but it’s almost worth getting captured as it sets up an awesome story sequence that sees you essentially being tortured in order to get you to join the cult.It also sets a sort of disconnect in the story. Throughout the story Joseph Seed has been giving strict orders that you should be captured rather than killed. So it makes sense that these hunter squads are out to capture, but for some reason every other cult member is out to kill you. I get it from a gameplay perspective but it’s weird seeing them constantly tell you that they want you captured and converted but everyone else is out to kill you.Far Cry 5 has seen a great refinement in gameplay and progression. Shooting mechanics have been refined to give a smother shooting experience through and through. Another improvement has come in the controls of vehicles. Flying a plane or helicopter is probably the easiest in any game I’ve played. There are even awesome side missions where you must try and complete courses based on a stunt man name Clutch Nixon.Far Cry 5’s biggest improvement comes in the form of the crafting and perk system. In past Far Cry titles you had to hunt animals and collect random loot to craft almost anything in the games. In Far Cry 5 the crafting has been refined to make it a little easier and less busy work. Almost all the materials can be found when looting dead cultist bodies.Crafting bombs and medkits is as easy as the two button presses. Simply press L1 to bring up the weapon wheel and select one of the items you want to craft with the right analog stick and hold triangle to craft it. In the past animal skins were used to craft various items, but this time around animal skins are used primary for selling and completing challenges.Challenges are the primary way to unlock perk points to unlock new skills. Challenges vary between exploration, hunting, and weapon proficiency. Hunting down three black bears will net you a perk point or getting ten sniper rifle kills will also net you a perk point. Some challenges will even have three stages allowing you to unlock up to three perk points.Perk points are used to unlock new abilities and skills. The Perk system is actually quite balanced when it comes to how many perk points are required to unlock abilities and how quickly you can earn them. Some skills I found were an absolute necessity to unlock as quickly as possible such as extra weapon slots and locking picking doors and safes.Far Cry 5 allows you to hire partners and use companions to help you out on missions. “Guns for Hire” allows you to take resistance members and hire them to help tag along as a virtual co-op partner. Most of the Guns for Hire are standard NPCs. The ones that truly matter are the “Companions.”Companions are characters who join you once you complete their unique missions. Boomer the dog is one such companion. There are nine in total and all of them are worth unlocking.Each companion comes with unique abilities that can benefit any situation. Boomer acts like a scout and spots enemies for you, while Nick Rye will take to the sky in his plane and lay down aerial support as well as dropping bombs in the middle of a battlefield. You must be careful though because they can be killed.If a companion falls, you have a short amount of time to revive them. If you fail to revive them you must wait about fifteen minutes before you’re able to use them again but you can shorten that time by buying specific perks. I love the companions in Far Cry 5. Each one of them not only helped with any given situation but each one had a great personality and I grew attached to them as I completed some of their personal quests.The companions aren’t perfect though. The enemy A.I. will simply ignore them even though they are clearly in their line of sight until you yourself get spotted. The other issue I had with the companions was how often they got in my way. I constantly found my companions getting in my way and not allowing me to move through door ways or get around to a hiding position because they were simply in my way.Far Cry 5 sees the return of Arcade Mode: an awesome addition that allows the community and players to create their own missions and maps. The creation tools are surprisingly easy to use and the large amounts of assets available should leave the table open for some great community missions to come.Solo and Co-op missions can be created in specific categories. Journey: allows you to make actual missions and even make your own type of mission like a horror mission or a platformer, and Bounty Hunt: Has you hunting down a specific target. These are just a couple of examples of missions that are available for creation.The big stand out in the Arcade mode is the ability to create your own multiplayer PVP maps. This opens up a massive advantage to Ubisoft in the multiplayer market. It also leaves them open to work on other things rather then releasing map packs for you to buy.Unfortunately the game modes are limited to only Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch. I’m hoping that Ubisoft releases more types of multiplayer game modes like Capture the Flag and Domination.Far Cry 5 as a great surprise for the franchise. As soon as the franchise started to feel a little stale, Ubisoft’s new action-adventure comes around and makes it fresh again. The setting and characters themselves are worth the price of admission but the great changes Far Cry 5 has made to the core mechanics and Far Cry Arcade gives the title an almost limitless amount of content.Far Cry 5 is the best Far Cry to date. The great additions and refinements made to the franchise are fantastic. Along with the inclusion of Far Cry Arcade, which extends your play time, Far Cry 5 is the ultimate open-world first person shooter.
